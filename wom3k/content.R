explanation <- "This Shiny app is a demo of a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing'>NLP</a> predictive model designed to help you write text faster by guessing the nexts words in fonction of what you already have typed in.<br/><br/>The model is built based on a corpus (collection of various text sources) about 200MB of 3 differents sources (some blogs, news and Twitter feeds).<br/><br/>After cleaning the text <i>(removing unwanted characters as numbers or words like hastags and logins)</i> <b>multiple ngrams</b> <i>(wondering what on earth is a ngram?! check <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram'>this link</a>)</i> of different levels are generated <i>(bigram, trigram, tetragram and pentagram)</i>.<br/><br/>The predictive model mainly use those shrinken ngrams <i>(we only keep ngram above a certain frequency to light the model and speed-up response time)</i> to find the next most probable word to complete the phrase the user type in.<br/>The <b>algorithm used is based on the stupid-backoff</b> <i>(a simplified version of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katz%27s_back-off_model'>Katz'one</a>)</i> is will first look in the highest ngram available depending on the number of input words and will <i>'backoff'</i> to inferior level if it does not find anything.<br/><br/><b>Example</b> if you type in 5 words <i>'please father I want to'</i>:<ol><li>it will only keep <i>'father I want to'</i> and look in 5-grams</li><li>if it does not find a candidate word, it will look in 4-grams with <i>'I want to'</i></li><li>then if necessary into 3-grams with <i>'want to'</i>...</li><li>then if necessary into 2-grams with <i>'want to'</i></li><li>if nothing works, it will dumbly return the most probable word from the corpus <i>(after removing <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words'>stopwords</a>)</i></li></ol>"
