That's not to say we don't take the event seriously, but I strongly believe our best work gets done when we can just relax and enjoy each other's company. That's when the creativity really flows."

During the Cold War, defense planners continuously assumed the need to prepare for a possible major war against the Warsaw Pact plus at least one other conflict. After the Cold War, the big scenario went away, and U.S. ground forces were sized and shaped primarily to maintain what was called a two-regional-war capability. The wars were assumed to begin in fairly rapid succession (though not exactly simultaneously), and then overlap, lasting several months to perhaps a year or two. Three administrations and five defense secretaries, starting with President George H.W. Bush and defense chief Dick Cheney, endorsed some variant of it. And to some extent, they were all vindicated in recent years as the nation fought two overlapping regional conflicts, even if one of them was in Richard Haass's memorable phrase a "war of choice," and even if the wars went on far longer than standard planning scenarios assumed.

How would they feel if Seventh Day Adventist (one Christian group) or Jewish religious leaders lobbied for a law to make Saturday the Sabbath and to limit commerce on that day? How would they feel if Mormon church leaders or the leaders of any other religious group in our country lobbied for laws that would impact everyone regardless of their conflicting religious beliefs?

For that I give them a lot of credit because I don't know if every organization would do that. I truly believe that's why I haven't really heard anything definitive from them.

It seems something beyond acting, in fact. Day-Lewis is famous for immersing himself in his roles. There is no hint of the actor here, nothing given away in his eyes, in his voice, anywhere. We are invested in Plainview from the start as a man, not just a character. This performance is the embodiment of the cliche that has adorned movie posters for generations, but truly, Day-Lewis is Plainview. Anderson, meanwhile, has made good movies before (Boogie Nights, Magnolia), but this is beyond good. If There Will Be Blood is ultimately bleak, it's also a monumental achievement, a movie and performance as great as they are unforgettable.

But I tend to believe in amplifying choices, as they create the clearest contrasts in campaigns for voters. Which is why, for Obama, I'd suggest Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. Start with the narrative of change: The visual shock of a national ticket made up of an African American and a woman would be tremendous. It would be, itself, change. But Sebelius brings more to the ticket: Where Obama speaks often of unity, of reaching across the aisle, Sebelius has done it in a fairly remarkable way. Skillfully sensing that the Kansas Republican Party's drift into extremism had alienated many of its moderate members, she asked the former chair of the Kansas Republicans to become a Democrat and run as her lieutenant governor; she convinced a popular Republican district attorney to switch parties and run for attorney general; and she flipped six candidates for the state Legislature. Obama muses dreamily of common ground, but Sebelius has a proven ability to find it. Add in that she's a widely regarded chief executive who Time magazine named one of the nation's best, and it's hard to think up a better fit.

Of the myriad miscalculations made by Obama, among the most fateful has to be his assumption that a repudiation of George W. Bush was synonymous with a repudiation of conservatism. By Election Day in 2008, Bush's approval rating was at 25 percent.

It was their opposition to Bush's big-government conservatism that made them the feedstock of the "tea parties."

What do you think motivates the oil and gas industry? Lower prices? America's energy independence?

Flash back to 1992, when Santa Clara County voters approved a half-cent hike in the local sales tax for road and rail improvements. It won by a simple majority vote, but the legal landscape was changing. Measures that listed what projects would be built were special taxes -- taxes that many thought needed a supermajority to pass legal muster.

"Defendants seek to delay review and approval of superintendent contracts for an unreasonable length of time, and until proposed regulations which purport to reduce and cap superintendent salaries take effect," the suit argues.
The whistlers proved to be very-low-frequency radio waves, which Helliwell began to monitor regularly and to reproduce with radio transmitters. If the entire atmosphere were electrically neutral like that at the Earth's surface, the radio waves would propagate directly into space, continuing in a straight line forever. But charged particles in the ionosphere and the magnetosphere above it can trap the waves and carry them long distances around the Earth or bounce them back to the surface the way a mirror bounces light.

Looks are deceiving. Electrocardiograms of the hearts of highly conditioned student athletes can bear a surprising resemblance to some ECGs of people with potentially dangerous heart problems, often creating false-positive results.
Michael settled in as the night proceeded, singing with greater flexibility and control. Every arena show must now include a small-band mini-set; Michael's benefited from being jazzy instead of folksy-acoustic. His rendition of Nina Simone's "Feeling Good," which he performed last season on the TV show "Eli Stone," was dynamite. Michael could make a big impact in this interpretive mode, giving Rod Stewart a serious run for his silk cravat.

Next was the St. Louis debut of Gabriele Cassone in Johann Nepomuk Hummel's trumpet concerto. It's a beautiful piece, full of charming melodies that emerge in the many dialogues between soloist and orchestra. Cassone's day job is as a professor at the Conservatory of Novara in Italy, and he played a trumpet of type that Hummel would have known, one with an early version of valves. His entrances, even on high, soft notes, were right on the money; and every line of every movement was not just played through but had interesting nuances of volume and tempo.

The game was not without the usual prickliness between the Cardinals and the Brewers. In the fifth inning, Jonathan Lucroy plowed Daniel Descalso as the latter attempted to field a groundball. Lucroy's curious collision cost the Brewers a run and it led later to an obvious bit of retaliation. Kyle McClellan hit Lucroy with a pitch in the ninth inning. The next batter, George Kottaras, cashed in on the extra base runner with the first pinch-hit homer of his career. Kottaras' three-run shot to center field tidied up a game that wasn't as close as its final score.

Mr. Staatz argues that the legislation is needed because community banks aren't lending. Nothing could be further from fact. Banks are actively lending and looking for lending opportunities. Banks earn a much higher return on loan interest than they do earnings on investments these days. Despite the sluggish economy, banks added over $180 billion in business loans over the last 18 months. Here in Maryland, more than $204 million in Small Business Administration Loans were made in 2011 alone, the vast majority by banks and the highest total in 10 years. Business lending increased 13.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 and totaled $1.3 trillion, according to the FDIC.

An infinitely rarer, more exotic version of the rood screen was the rood loft, requiring a church of considerable height and scope to accommodate it. As its name implies, the loft was an enclosed structure, raised well above the building's floor, under which worshipers could pass comfortably. Normally made of elaborately carved wood, it too succumbed to the iconoclasts and the reformers. The puzzling, orphaned circular staircases on flanking sides of the nave in some ancient churches are vestiges of these structures.

The 30-second TV spots portray the "Protect Our Homes" initiative as a constraint on eminent domain. It would prohibit cities from using their condemnation powers to transfer property from one owner to the other, such as was done in the Connecticut case that drew national outrage when the U.S. Supreme Court allowed it. It would also strengthen the negotiating hand of landowners whose property is being sought for schools, freeways or other public uses.

The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood and Englewood Hospital and Medical Center oppose the plan to reopen. Executives say Bergen County already has up to 400 vacant hospital beds and reopening Pascack Valley would harm existing hospitals financially.
At that figure, Facebook's valuation would also be about 33 times its advertising revenue, compared with 5.5 times for Google. The reason for the discrepancy is in large part due to the fact that Facebook is still a young company with faster growth than Google, which is worth $200 billion but had $36.5 billion in ad revenue last year.

There are a few hidden fun spots in between all the blacktop, like the 10-year-old Museum of Making Music, tucked away in the back of an office park. Why Carlsbad? Because its home to NAMM. That's what used to be called the National Association of Music Merchants, which they've ditched for just using the acronym. The temporary exhibit, "ON! The Beginnings of the Electric Sound Generation," examines how early musical pioneers harnessed electricity to amplify and modulate music. Your ringing ears after a Led Zeppelin or Lady Gaga concert are due to old-timers like Thaddeus Cahill, who invented electromechanical instruments that prefigured today's streaming audio. There are guitar pioneers like Leo Fender, who worked on taking the six string and pumping up the volume with voltage. The big draw for musicians is the "interactive" exhibit where visitors can try out a Gretsch Sparkle Jet guitar, Deering Goodtime banjo or just wail away on a set of Hapi drums.

"In reality, the majority of players who are signed from Latin American in any given year are older than 16," he said. "The average age is closer to 18 to 19.

Parents should set rules for consuming Halloween candy and explain them to their kids well before the holiday so that they know what to expect, says Dorian Traube, an assistant professor at the USC School of Social Work.

Directed by Giovanna Sardelli, the show starts off like a run-of-the-mill dramedy, until it becomes apparent that something more is going on.

"From the perspective of politics and clout, one of the things that is problematic is that you just don't have an organization that stands for the middle class," said Solon Simmons, a sociologist and assistant professor who specializes in American politics at George Mason University's School for Conflict Analysis and Resolution in Virginia. "You've got lobbying groups that stand for various corporations, various interest groups, various business segments, but you don't really have a middle-class organization like workers once had unions. You've got the (national seniors organization) AARP, but it doesn't stand specifically for the middle class. And without that kind of organization, you're simply unlikely to get much bang for your buck in Washington, D.C."

øA: We've created 80,000 jobs in the last month, and in the last couple of reporting periods, the number went up. The unemployment rate went down from 9.1% to 9%, so we're making a little progress. The economy is growing close to 2.5%, but until it gets to 3.5%, we're not going to begin to create enough jobs. We're getting just about enough to replace people that are retiring or going out of the workforce. But we have people coming into the workforce, coming out of school, out of training, and we're not going to create enough jobs in this country to get 3.5% growth.

Stewart, officially listed as day to day on the injury report, hasn't played since suffering a knee injury on Oct. 15 at Washington.

Not so long ago, Price's business would have raised eyebrows among cops. But today, police barely pay attention to the Converse-clad 26-year-old from Arizona. As Oregonians show increasing tolerance for the drug maligned in the cult classic "Reefer Madness," Price is part of a growing class of entrepreneurs moving marijuana through Main Street establishments across Oregon, especially in Multnomah County.

The Fuentes brothers, from San Diego, sure are showoffs — the sort of guys who will cram finger-tapping, shredding, gentle strumming and harmony soloing in the same three-minute song. But that’s exactly what makes Pierce The Veil so much fun. These guys throw so much at the listener, in such a frenzy, that some of it is bound to stick. If you don’t like the way a verse sounds, wait 10 seconds, and you’re sure to get something different.

Chip Kelly said he hadn't decided if he was going to close practice for the rest of the season, but I don't think it would come as a shock to anyone if he did.

I'm in my 25th year writing about food and restaurants in San Francisco, and I truly believe this is the best year for openings.

Dereliction of duty or all part of the plan? Obama’s strategy this year — in addition to demonizing whichever Republican gets the nod to challenge him — will be to run against a “do-nothing” Congress, a la Harry Truman in 1948.

Don't forget the Lightning Field, an art installation outside Quemado where (for $150 to $250 a person) you spend a summer night in a wood cabin and wait to see if lightning will strike one of the 400 tall steel poles outside your door. Even if there's no strike, the sky puts on shows at sunset and sunrise that will leave you in awe.

Why wouldn't a Browns' defense that held the Steelers to 27 points in two games be up to confusing rookie quarterbacks (not named Dalton)?

Plastics are estimated to make up 90 percent of the ocean's trash. The United States dumps about 5 million pounds of plastic into the ocean, or roughly 15 pounds per person every year. As a result, an estimated 35 percent of ocean fish have plastic in their stomachs, including bottom feeders nowhere near the ocean surface.
The fish might change, but the quality doesn't. These hearty tacos from Jason Hoffman and Justin Close feature lightly battered fish fillets topped with shredded Little Gem lettuce, sriracha mayo and pickled radishes. $5. www.thetacoguys.com.

But in the last half of the 20th century, technology played an ever-greater role in the development of wine. California wineries were the leaders in this in the '70s and '80s, spurring an evolution throughout the world. By expanding the geography of where stable, quality wines could be produced, production increased and costs fell. By developing methods of controlling the temperature of fermentation, for instance, winemakers could now produce wines of ripe, bold character that had structure with some restraint and elegance - regardless of their region's climate.

Dogs learn by experimenting with behaviors that pay off. If jumping on a counter means the animal is going to be rewarded by finding a hamburger it will continue to jump on counters because it was rewarded in the past for doing so. Similarly, if a dog is rewarded every time it lays down in another room when you're preparing meals the dog will learn that laying in that particular spot always pays off. Since dogs engage in behaviors that require the least effort to achieve goals, laying in another room for rewards is much less work than leaping on a counter. Room service, please!

Currently, colonoscopies remain the physician's best tool for the early detection of colon cancer in patients. However, many patients remain fearful of the test, due to its uncomfortable, laxative-based preparation and its cost (when not covered by insurance).

In 2009, the American Cancer Society added DNA testing to its colon cancer screening guidelines.

For example, when the sun suddenly shines over a wet field, the mud in that field cracks as it dries suddenly. If the mud dries slowly, there is no cracking. The same scenario occurs on the skin. Rapid drying is far more damaging to the skin than slow drying; therefore minimizing exposure to wet-dry cycles will often prevent ICD.

In 1998, the Cardinals took J. D. Drew with the fifth pick overall (a redraft, really), and he went on to hit 96 homers with a .875 OPS and a 124 OPS+ in 597 games for the Cardinals. He then, of course, was flipped in the deal that retooled the Cardinals for their two 100-win seasons and brought Adam Wainwright (29th overall, 2000) into the system from Atlanta. Drew came at the end of a stretch of first-rounders that nourished the Cardinals for a few years. Braden Looper was the third overall pick in 1996, Adam Kennedy went 20th overall in 1997, and back in 1995 with the 12th pick overall the Cardinals took Matt Morris. Like a few of the contemporary first-rounders, Kennedy and Looper were part of deals that immediately (and incredibly) enhanced the major-league roster. Kennedy was part of the Jim Edmonds deal, and Looper went to Florida in exchange for Edgar Renteria. See it's not just a recent trend, it's a strategy.

Ironically, the bill also has support in the Senate even though past efforts have died in that chamber. Sen. Patrick Leahy, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has supported the legislation in past years along with at least 20 others in the chamber.

Brother Jeff Fard, executive director of Brother Jeff's Cultural Center, said that Hickenlooper's remarks about Hancock and his wife showering play into a long history about sexualizing blacks. Both the mayor and the first lady are black.
Step 4: Follow the tent rule. "Brokeback Mountain" is top-quality filmmaking, and you should enjoy it in its entirety. But if you start to feel panicky -- as if you might hop to another theater and watch "Glory Road" -- simply follow the Heath Ledger Tent Rule. Every time Ledger's character, Ennis, crawls into a tent, take a trip to the restroom or refreshment stand, and make sure you're gone for at least three minutes. If you do that, then "Brokeback Mountain" is pretty much like watching an episode of "Will & Grace."

The book "The Trophy Kids Grow Up" by Ron Alsop claims this entitlement mentality, a highly structured childhood, inadequate leadership skills and an inability to problem solve results in a lack of independence and entrepreneurialism.

Jacoby implores Romney to support Dream 2.0 so members of the GOP will not be seen as "heartless villains." I urge him to reject it. The original Dream Act enjoyed bipartisan support because it was the right thing to do. Dream 2.0 should be seen for what it is: a divisive ploy to pander to Latinos. It is a faulty compromise at best -- and a nightmare at worst.

McGinest and Browns coach Eric Mangini were in New England together, but it's not known if Mangini is interested in re-signing him.

So, too, is Hoover's relationship with Clyde Tolson (Hammer), to whom Hoover takes an immediate liking. Or perhaps there is more to the attraction (some scenes suggest this, though never overtly). Hoover hires Tolson as his second in command; he's mostly seen as a quasi-romantic interest but also serves as a not-always-successful conscience for Hoover when the latter goes too far with his law-enforcement methods.

The more important question: What does one generation have to gain  or lose  from the name with which it's tagged? Certainly, no one wants to be linked to a generation of deadbeats or lowlifes. Little wonder those names have never risen to the top of any generational list. None officially dubbed Pathetic Generation  at least, not yet. But some might call Gen Z  a term still in-the-running for the next generation  rather off-putting. If Boomers felt a sense of common strength, Millennials may have felt a sense of shared destination. Ultimately, a generational name reflects its hope or pessimism.

Within the extensive menu, the soups we tried - including the Seafood Noodle Soup, rice noodles with succulent shrimp, squid, scallop and aromatic fish balls ($9) - were well-crafted and nicely balanced. The Saigon-signature Pho ($11), arguably the national dish of Vietnam, is a credit to its country and its local cook. The meal in a giant soup bowl is classically perfect, a steaming beefy broth made fragrantly delicious with the rich roasted flavors of cinnamon, ginger and anise, filled almost to the brim with tender soup-cooked slices of rare beef, delightfully chewy beef meatballs, flavorful brisket and silken rice noodles. With the traditional self-customizing accoutrement of bean sprouts, hot peppers, lime wedges, Thai basil sprigs, hoisin and chili sauces to add as you go, it becomes an over-flowing bowl of sheer goodness.

In what world does it make sense to complain about draconian cuts when the state is actually spending more money?

The price of oil jumped again Thursday, to $107.83, a nine-month high and up $1.52 for the day. Besides Iran, analysts blamed the falling U.S. dollar. When the dollar falls in value, it takes more dollars for foreign buyers to pay for the same barrel of oil.

This line of thinking is actually known as "Bennett's hypothesis," a reference to former Education Secretary William Bennett, who complained in 1977 that federal aid enabled universities "blithely to raise their tuitions." It's disputed, but there is some evidence to support it. For example, a study this year by Stephanie Riegg Cellini and Claudia Goldin found strong evidence that federal aid led to higher tuition at for-profit colleges. And Andrew Gillen, research director at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, released a report in February arguing that there is a link between tuition increases and education subsidies for middle-class and wealthy families (e.g., tuition tax credits).

On an unusually hot July day in London, my two young boys and I tied our superfluous windbreakers around our waists as we headed back out into the midday sun. We had just toured the London Dungeon, a spooky tourist attraction that thrilled the boys with its macabre, lifelike scenes of plague, fire and general mayhem. After a long visit in the attraction's gift shop it was time to search for a nearby activity that would provide another "cool" respite for my young sons and me in terms of cultural sites and body temperature.

You do not have to camp here to experience the Stanley Basin. There are motels and a few guest ranches available. I was stunned at the growth of the old Redfish Lake Lodge. It has doubled, perhaps tripled, in size, and the lakefront was awash in people. When I last saw it, a mother bear and two cubs were frolicking in a sudden autumn snowfall, and a few cabins were being hand-hewn from local timber. Those cabins remain, but many more have been added. Everyone did seem to be having a good time.

The facts are these: No one has ever been fired or denied tenure (or "expelled" from school) for challenging Darwinism or for promoting "intelligent design," or ID creationism. The details of each alleged case of persecution presented in the film can be found at the aforementioned websites, but take it from a former creationist (when I was an evangelical Christian) and current evolutionary theorist (I teach a course in the subject at Claremont Graduate University) that Darwinism always has been and continues to be challenged by scientists. In Charles Darwin's own time, of course, numerous books and articles were published critiquing his theory, and through the turn of the century there was still no underlying mechanism to explain how natural selection works and why so much skepticism remained. From the 1930s through the '60s, the neo-Darwinian synthesis and its many variants seriously revised many aspects of Darwin's original theory. In the '70s, Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge successfully remodeled Darwinian gradualism with their theory of punctuated equilibrium.

"We never really said we have to (draft a back)," Devaney said. "If it happened, it happened. We were probably close a couple times. We didn't force it and reach for this guy because we had to have a running back. There were running backs we were thinking of taking, and if they went before our next pick came up, we didn't react by saying, 'We lost a back, now we've got to drop down in value in this round. Take a back no matter what, even if he doesn't warrant going there.'

Maintaining and keeping up with these kinds of costs is difficult when the city annually has about $600,000 for equipment, buildings and streets and $400,000 for all utilities.

Cars.com puts it this way in its 2011 AMI report: "In today's global economy, there's no easy way to determine just how American a car is. Many cars built in the U.S., for example, are assembled using parts that come from elsewhere. Some cars assembled in the U.S. from largely American-made parts don't sell well, meaning fewer Americans are employed to build them. Cars.com's American-Made Index recognizes cars that are built here, have a high amount of domestic parts and are bought in large numbers by American consumers."
Doctors don't keep track of how much radiation their patients receive from testing. They just order a scan, and how much radiation results can vary widely by the age and brand of machine, and the possible diagnosis.

The 44 prose poems of "Illuminations" were Arthur Rimbaud's goodbye to poetry (though he had said goodbye before); they are poised on the brink of a new world.

Jeffery was a bit uncoordinated early in his career and only began to look comfortable in his body toward the end of his collegiate career.

Women who surrender a child after the law’s enactment would not have a guarantee of privacy. They would submit a contact "preference" form to the state, stating their wish to be contacted directly, contacted through an intermediary or not contacted at all. But the state would still furnish upon the adopted person’s request the complete birth certificate, leaving it up to the adoptee to decide whether to honor the birth parent’s request.

Finally, aside from how a surgery is being performed, be sure that you are being cared for in a team approach. This model is the most beneficial to the patient and means a team of physicians - a radiation oncologist, medical oncologist and surgeon - plus your mammographer, breast pathologist and nurse navigator work together to provide a team approach to your care. A nurse navigator is someone who acts as a patient advocate tailoring the care to best fit each patient. He or she will work closely with your team of medical professional to schedule appointments providing helpful resources.

The annual unemployment rate in the ensuing years never exceeded 4.2 percent. Moreover, the recovery from the 1920-21 recession was quick and without any other government intervention. As Mr. Mellon said at the time, "Just as labor cannot be forced to work against its will, so it can be taken for granted that capital will not work unless the return is worthwhile. It will continue to retire into the shelter of tax-exempt bonds, which offer both security and immunity from the tax collector."

"This is where Brockers is a dominant force. I have seen very few defensive linemen that can so easily jolt OL run blockers upright and backwards, toss them aside and make tackles behind the line.

“Did it go through my mind? Obviously, yes,” he said. “Obviously, you come through a situation where you’ve been here for a long time and you’ve won (a) Super Bowl, you’ve been to the Pro Bowl a couple of times and then things like that start happening, you start being benched and they say you’re coming in on the third-down rush. It almost seemed as if the writing was on the wall at that particular time. I felt like I had worn out my welcome, because once teams start doing things like that, it seems like you’ve obviously worn out your welcome. For certain people, no matter what happens, they’ll never take them out of the lineup. ... But you never know, man. I hope it’s not. I hope things can be rectified and things can be resolved.

Season recap: With Xavier fielding an inexperienced squad this season, Schmelzel was called on to be the leader. She thrived in that role, not only being a vocal presence among the players but she set the standard on the course. Her match average this season on nine holes was 34, and she had a putting average of 14 strokes per round. She played her best at the Division I state tournament. Schmelzel was the only player in Xavier's top five who had any state tournament experience, and she used that to guide Xavier to the team title. She also nabbed the individual championship, shooting a two-day total of 7-under-par 137.

What troubles me is that hotels don't seem to be listening to their guests when they revert to a pay-for-access model and get aggressive about maximizing their revenue. Most hotel guests need a clear, fast wireless signal, and they'd prefer it to be included in their room rate. Guests who prefer not to 'subsidize" wireless access can always stay at hotels that charge to get online - there will always be a few that do.

The Hockey News: "The Sharks boast a nice arsenal of big, strong forwards who can hold onto the puck and exert pressure in the offensive zone.

"Dropped Names": If Frank Langella's memoir simply did what its title promises, it would be deep-dish gossip. But his memories of the stars he's encountered during a lengthy career on Broadway and in film shed perceptive light on the costs of pursuing and maintaining fame. There are revealing tidbits like his description of a relaxed President Jack Kennedy howling at Noel Coward's jokes and doing a soft-shoe routine with Fred Astaire's sister Adele. And considering the impressions he offers of Anne Bancroft's egotism and Richard Burton's boozy decline, Paul Newman gets off easy by just being called dull. Whether he's flattering or skewering, Langella doesn't shy away from noting that celebrities are just like us, precisely because they're flawed human beings.

On Sept. 11, 2001, as we sat transfixed to our televisions, we were overwhelmed with empathy for those in the towers and the planes and the Pentagon. We tried to imagine what was happening to them and waited for news of survivors.

Our nation and people from around the world, in a stunning show of compassion, gave freely and generously to benefit the families and the survivors. Many gave who had little to spare.
According to the plaintiffs, Humphreys announced to paramedics and civilian witnesses that he had found cocaine belonging to Chasse, when in fact he knew that what he had found and bagged as evidence were bread crumbs, court files say.

The farmer (the reliably terrific Gary Norman), who has found the wounded man, views him with a mix of awe and suspicion, yet treats him with basic human decency. The farmer’s daughter, Evie (Britt Harris as a starry-eyed idealist), says that he glows and considers his arrival an omen of good fortune. The translator (Andy Lee-Hillstrom, hiding mean-spiritedness behind mildness) sees him as a vehicle for propaganda and/or revenge. The trader (played by Joel Harmon as a perpetually annoyed middle-manager) disavows ethical or political considerations, declaring his loyalty to “the margin.”
Kurt Thomas was a smart addition, but is 39 and leaves the Blazers too short to play big minutes at center. Coach Nate McMillan doesn't yet fully believe in Chris Johnson.

Jeff redid plumbing, and they added decks, fencing, landscaping and built several outbuildings.
Taco María is a product of that natural selection. The truck is helmed by Carlos Salgado, whose culinary pedigree instantly drove Taco María onto the radar screen of every serious Orange County eater. His has indeed an impressive résumé: Salgado served as pastry chef in some of the Bay Area's top restaurants, including Daniel Patterson's Coi and Oakland's Commis. He returned home to Orange County to help his parents transform the family's taquería. Taco María is what emerged from that reinvention, a truck that's constantly re-imagining lonchera traditions with the techniques and style of Mexican alta cocina.

All these people chose to end their own life. I do not fully understand the sadness and despair that lead to that decision but I do know the pain, confusion and loss that is left after.

If you're not the heart-cutting type, omit this step.

This fall, with Crist under center and a new offensive system in place, Weis says he'd like to get Pierson the ball about 15 times a game. Maybe more. Maybe less. The Jayhawks have depth at running back, Weis says, and there's no reason to let Pierson take a pounding.
It was much the same story at the house of Hermès, the vaunted French maker of saddles and tackle as far back as 1837. Designer Véronique Nichanian put that mastery of leather to work in an unexpected way — a streetwear-inspired hooded sweatshirt in suede with a silk lining. It's hard to think of any place on earth but Southern California where a guy might buy such an item, much less wear it (I can see Jeremy Piven buying two — one in "aniseed" green and one in red). The collection also includes uncharacteristically preppy madras checks, roughly textured cotton seersuckers and drapy V-neck pullover sweaters.
The California Highway Patrol responded. One of the officers looked over the railing. He saw a body floating about 100 yards east of the bridge and dropped a flare.

Jennifer Bertrand, an Olathe-based designer, won HGTV's Design Star in 2008. As part of her prize, she was given her own design show on the channel.

Baseball's opening day in April will roughly coincide with another opening day: the move of Elliott Bay Books from its longtime home in Pioneer Square to a new location in the Capitol Hill. Like many independent bookstores, Elliott Bay has had to struggle in a digital world where selling analog devices (books) isn't the business it once was.

The wonderfully eclectic Elliott Bay Cafe will stay in the basement of the Pioneer Square building, hoping that the lunch crowds coming in for veggie chili and organic doughnuts will keep coming when the book store is gone.

2. In your essay on the subject of hell you said, "I happen to be one of those who think God will eventually incinerate some people". That sounds like a fairly literal understanding of hell.

I like Lady Gaga, and always have. I admire her entertainment-biz smarts and acknowledge her deep respect for pop history. She’s made excellent career moves and, almost incidentally, recorded some exciting music. But with "Born This Way," she’s pushed the machine too far. Curiosity will catapult the single to the top of the charts. Once it’s there, though, there’s no taking it back: every radio speaker in America will be broadcasting its essential ordinariness. Gaga has managed to sell millions of records while retaining credibility among hipsters. That ends now. This too-safe effort is going to demolish her cool.

The chow: Those who've had Chilequiles ($6) swear by the Mexican breakfast staple, for reportedly curing hangovers and satisfying a mean hunger. Cathedral Park Kitchen makes its own variation by cooking tortilla chips in homemade tomatillo salsa, and then covering them with two scrambled eggs, cheese and sides of salsa and sour cream. While a bit more of the salsa would have moistened the dish up some, the flavor was sweet and salty, with just a hint of heat. The breakfast burrito ($7) was stuffed with eggs, sausage, pepper jack cheese, diced tomatoes and tomatillo salsa, and was even better.

Hey, Mary Kay: Two picks that intrigue me are Cordy Glenn or Quinton Coples at No. 22. I believe Coples has a chance to fall because of poor effort and showing last year.

Glenn, on the other hand, has not been mentioned much, but offers an immediate starting RT. -- Mik Kao, Saint Paul, Minn.
The cases are unrelated, other than some legal commonalities and that they fall under the jurisdiction of the federal 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. The role of two Portland firms in similar cases is coincidental, other than what it may say about the national caliber of their attorneys.

Maybe it was because he so keenly felt the premature loss of his own childhood to stardom and the limelight that he went to such lengths to keep his children's identity private. Who can forget the bizarre shots of the children in masks and scarves over their faces? Strange or not, it worked. Could you pick them out of a line-up?

"When I played club ball, you just had tryouts. You had a day, possibly two days," said Greg Rheinheimer, who coaches WC St. Louis' U8 Gunners boys team. "You had a coach and maybe 300 kids come out for a tryout. The coach has to evaluate the kids in a matter of two hours. You can't evaluate how good each player is like that. Maybe they have a bad day, or maybe they're a little shy."

If it seems odd, perhaps even dysfunctional, that an organization would operate without a permanent GM for an entire season and dangle a group of executives along the way, Miller says it’s an unfortunate byproduct of circumstance. After kicking the tires on six GM candidates over the summer, Miller suspended the search on Nov. 16, when it was a real possibility the lockout would wipe out the entire season and he thought a new GM’s salary was better spent preserving jobs within the organization.

Whatever Americans pay for gasoline, increasing domestic production to 10 million barrels a day would cut combined crude oil and gasoline imports in half — saving at least $150 billion a year. That money would be spent in the United States on cement, steel, engineering services and the like, and by my estimates, it would boost gross domestic product by $250 billion, create about 2.5 million jobs and lower unemployment to less than 7 percent.

Saying this brings no pleasure. Of all the recent comic-book transplants to the big screen, Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker has been the most likable, quirky and reliably human, even when he's squirting web-juice from his hands as the semi-superhuman Spider-Man. And the series has gained in grace from Peter's fraught love for Kirsten Dunst's winsome and endearing Mary Jane Watson. Yet the third go-round conventionalizes its hero by throwing him into repetitive struggles with his dark side. (Clothes and the man make each other here, since the black symbiotic substance that's responsible for his darkness and alarming arrogance turns his costume from red and blue to jet black.) And the script traps him and M.J. in a domestic struggle that's straight out of "A Star Is Born."

By dwelling on the negative, Romney would risk turning the case for his own candidacy into nothing more than “I’m the best you’ve got, you might as well go with me.” There are precedents for such candidacies, and they are not good ones: Michael Dukakis in 1988 and Bob Dole in 1996.

Hey, Tony: Will Randy Lerner ever address the fans? Obviously Tom Heckert has failed in two drafts. Mike Holmgren obviously is past his prime. His hiring of Pat Shurmur is a joke. Lerner should refund season-ticket holders. This franchise embodies ineptitude at all levels and they don't even seem to care. Why is that? Obviously the only chance for us to succeed is to force Lerner to sell the team. -- James Heneghan, Swedesboro, N.J.

* In losing the first three games of the conference semifinals, the Blues are also dealing with something that they haven't experienced for a long time: a draining loss of confidence. The Blues were shaken by the loss of defenseman Alex Pietrangelo late in the second period of Game 1. He's their best player. His skills are crucial to the Blues in every aspect of the game. But I was surprised by how the Blues collapsed in Game 2. Their failure to handle the Pietrangelo affair was stunning. Sure, he returned in Game 3, but by then the damage was done. The Blues' confidence was shot, and the Kings were in complete command. The Blues' customary resilience disintegrated when Petro was taken out on a dirty hit. The Kings, already confident, were absolutely emboldened by the Pietrangelo hit job and the Blues' subsequent non-response.
In the front yard, a swirl of brilliant maple leaves floated toward the ground.

We’ll get this out of the way first — Floyd has three alcohol-related arrests since 2009, something that is no doubt on the top of his file and something he was grilled about to no end during the combine process. Whether it costs him a few spots remains to be seen. But on the field, there are arguments to be made that Floyd is a better natural receiver than Blackmon. He has tremendous hands and the ability to make show-stopping catches anywhere on the field. Keep in mind, too, that he was double teamed at Notre Dame more often than not.

If he had that kind of money, I asked, why rush around the world? "You go some place for two weeks and if you don't like it, you're stuck," he said. "This trip is a sampler, like a buffet. You can always go back for seconds for the destinations you really like."

Mr. Forssman, a gentle, humble man, knew how to connect every student to literature by getting us to dig deep into the text.

A combo guard with 3-point range, Galland runs the point for head coach Jim Redmon at Lewis and Clark. She scored a game-high 24 points – including 10 in the fourth quarter – as the Tigers defeated Federal Way High School, 62-49, in last season’s championship game.

The basics: Mid-century modern architecture in the United States is a direct descendant of the unadorned-modernist minimalism adapted from the German Bauhaus design tradition of the 1920s and early 1930s. It's no surprise, then, that immigrant architects Oscar and Hans Gerson Sr. chose upon their arrival in America to land in the Bay Area, where the updated style was flourishing.
"We weren't ready to play," Beavers coach Craig Robinson said. "The beginning of the game looked real good, and I don't know if it's the altitude, I don't if it's complacency, but a lot of it has to do with the fact that they played real good."

Although he arrived in San Francisco as Germany was surrendering to the Allies in April 1945, Mr. Hartman was in no mood for a victory celebration. His injuries remained so severe, he needed help disembarking.
The health care debate has been severely hampered by fear, myths, and by hyper-partisanship. The President clearly does not advocate socialism or a government takeover of health care.

Frankly, Oshie's hockey value was still open to interpretation as he began his fourth season. At times, he looked like a top-three forward. At other times, he looked like he might be best suited batting lower in the order. Case in point, Oshie spent a third period in Philadelphia sitting on the bench earlier this season, put in time-out by coach Davis Payne. Through 11 games, he had one goal and four assists, hardly top-tier stuff.

It found that 21% were somewhat or very pessimistic about global trade through the rest of the year.

Public service: The Philadelphia Inquirer for its exploration of pervasive violence in the city's schools, using powerful print narratives and videos to illuminate crimes committed by children against children and to stir reforms to improve safety for teachers and students. Finalists: The Miami Herald for its exposure of deadly abuses and lax state oversight in Florida's assisted-living facilities for the elderly and mentally ill that resulted in the closure of dangerous homes, punishment of violators and creation of tougher laws and regulations, and The New York Times for the work of Danny Hakim and Russ Buettner that revealed rapes, beatings and more than 1,200 unexplained deaths over the past decade of developmentally disabled people in New York State group homes, leading to removal of two top officials, movement to fire 130 employees and passage of remedial laws.
Smart shopping means choosing items you can use year-round, experts say, then adding little touches and accents to change it up. Think separate colors; lots of candles and see-through glass; and say no to stripes.

It appears Badgett's expert testimony is going to get close attention from both sides in the trial. She is being questioned by David Boies, one of the plaintiffs' top guns in the case, and the cross-examination is apparently going to be handled by Proposition 8's lead lawyer, Charles Cooper. Based on the past cross-examinations of the plaintiffs experts, Badgett can expect a long day on the stand today.

I found the rough, rickety and rundown Leap-the-Dips at Lakemont Park to be the perfect throwback to the golden age of coasters, when thrills were raw and wild rather than neutered by lawyers and lawmakers. The 109-year-old ride crystalized everything I was searching for in my road trip across the coaster belt: history, tradition, rarity, excitement and fun.
"Honestly, I felt good," Halladay said. "I didn't execute pitches. It had nothing to do with anything else. I wish I had a better reason for you, but I don't. It was just a lack of executing pitches in key situations."

Prince Harry recently announced plans to return to San Diego this summer. Except this time, his Southern California travel is dedicated to a charitable cause very close to his heart.
Coming out of the most religiously observant decade of American history, the 1950s, Putnam observed that we witnessed two seismic shocks in American public life. First, the social and political upheaval of the 1960s, during which time religious observance plummeted. Second, the social counterreaction to the 1960s that eventually coalesced in the Religious Right of the 1980s. (Although Putnam was adamant to note that this counterreaction began as a social and moral movement and not a political one.)

More precisely, umami is considered to be the fifth taste. It's a relatively new addition to the original four key sensory experiences related to taste: sweet, sour, salty and bitter. The direct Japanese translation does mean "delicious flavor" -- but the working definition conveys a more specific savory or meaty taste. Think briny oysters, woodsy mushrooms, vintage cheeses and rich hearty stocks. Umami is a distinct but subtle effect, blending well with other foods to enhance and deepen flavors.

I am also glad that my family and I are Democrats. After watching various Republican debates to earn extra credit in my "AP Government and Politics" class, I have come to the conclusion that the Republican candidates have the maturity level of elementary schoolchildren. That may seem like a harsh judgment coming from somebody who doesn't know a lot about politics, but that supports my case even more.
Diabetes damages health in a number of ways. People with diabetes are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease, stroke and renal disease. Also, diabetes sufferers have a lower health-related quality of life. Diabetes is also related to an excess risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, the main form of liver cancer, and being overweight likely contributes to this.

Watching the dinner-speaker spectacle develop, then unravel, then redevelop (Will she or won't she speak/attend?) felt like watching a middle-school romance in which a friend tells another friend that so-and-so has a crush on you-know-who, but don't tell anybody. A little silly, in other words. And embarrassing. The "tick-tock" of what happened is a Byzantine exercise in blame-shifting. Briefly, someone in Palin's "organization" accepted the original invitation in March, whereupon the dinner hosts issued a press release announcing that Palin would be the keynote speaker.

Skylar Laine, "You Don't Have to Say You Love Me:" Ah, "Idol" theme weeks. Yes, this was a hit by the very British Dusty Springfield, but it's also originally an Italian song. You can hear its sheer Italian-ness in the flowing melody and the huge chorus. Jimmy and Little Steven both talk about the song needing to be moved to the country arena, which seems like a stretch. Even when Elvis sang it, it sounded Italian. Skylar doesn't do much with it, plus she's cursed with some of the dopiest staging in "Idol" history: She walks on stage past a couple silhouetted on a park bench. Is this "American Idol" or "The Lawrence Welk Show?" At the end, Skylar winds up shouting her way out of the song. Not one of her better performances, though the judges are more enthusiastic.
Although I had been using the term "rape" in conversation to describe the Penn State incident, I had not considered other language we rely on to describe sexual assault.

Many congregations this Sunday will hear Luke's account of the annunciation of Mary by Gabriel. The angel Gabriel addresses Mary as the recipient of God's favor, the chosen one of God-and invites her to discern her calling. Mary is perplexed by the announcement. "How can this be?" she wonders. "Nothing will be impossible with God," the messenger reminds Mary, standing before her as she continues to ponder her calling. It is a holy moment. As Presbyterian theologian Cynthia Rigby notes, "Mary's obedience is neither optional nor forced. Mary acts freely when she offers herself as a servant of the Lord." Because of an angel, Mary embraces her calling.
With Matthies retiring, the city is not interested in promoting from within. It is seeking an outsider with a canny eye toward promotional magic, in particular the use of social media to generate buzz.

Busch needs a minimum of 1,500 people to keep the place open seven days a week. They bulk the staff up to 4,500 for the peak summer and winter seasons between Christmas and Easter. But needs vary dramatically with weather, the day of the week, the time of day and attendance projections, so the park has made schedule juggling an art form.
The aggressiveness of these pictures (another one thrusts prosthetic butt cheeks erupting with pimples in the viewer's face) reflects Sherman's self-professed attempt to be less likable, less collectible. The gambit didn't seem to make a dent in her popularity, nor did a later set of images of creepy, threatening clowns or perversely reconfigured body parts from medical supply shops that make Hans Bellmer's erotic doll photographs look quaint in comparison.

The mayor should, at a minimum, be willing to tell us how decisions are being made. Are we relying on the same individuals who were unable to see the faults of the original Grand Prix business plan to evaluate plans for future events? Are any independent reviews or outside financial consultants (uninvolved in politics) being used to evaluate proposals before we commit our city's scarce resources to another event? For that matter, has anyone at City Hall been held responsible for the failure of the administration to see and forestall the financial disaster we now know the Labor Day event to be?

But "viewing" the "texts" of biographical movies put me in a quandary because my two very different sets of standards conflicted. I could hardly keep a straight face during the excesses and scenery chewing of "The Aviator," for instance, yet I found it far more enjoyable than the carefully and logically wrought "Kinsey." Yet "Kinsey" was the only movie — I meant to say text — from which I felt I learned anything worth knowing about its subject. The others amounted to varying degrees of escapism.

In the end, downsizing mistakes are made by companies that do not take the time to fully understand the problems they think job cuts will solve. They see profits falling by a certain percentage and conclude that labor costs must be cut by a certain percentage.
Martelly condemned evictions, but they happened anyway. Yet Jean-Baptiste still holds out hope for the candidate who promised change.

Four years ago last month I covered my first Maryland football Signing Day for The Baltimore Sun. There wasn't a consensus opinion on the Terps' 2008 recruiting class -- Rivals.com ranked it the No. 38 group in the country, while Scout.com had it listed as the 52nd-best class nationally. So how did Maryland's 2008 group ultimately stack up? Let's revisit my 2008 superlatives and find out.

Amber Corneliuson, 28, of Northeast Portland, is a Polaroid artist who focuses on interactive installations. Her recent fascination with Polaroids — she loves their immediacy — led to her just-closed show, “First Kiss,” at the Mark Woolley Gallery at the Wonder Ballroom. Guests at the show’s opening posed for Polaroid photos, attached descriptions of their first kisses (“like sticking my tongue in cat food”) and pinned them to the wall. The exhibit ran out of film.

EA: I'm now in a position to help change and rectify, to reach out and be of assistance to other people. Not only did I deal with stalking, I dealt with video voyeurism. I'm working with lawmakers in my hometown in Florida for new laws against video voyeurism. What happened to me is still happening, and as technology gets better and better, it's going to get worse and worse. Right now, the laws for video voyeurism are an absolute joke. They're outdated.

Lin, the former Palo Alto High star, became the biggest story in the NBA in February when he went from undrafted benchwarmer out of Harvard to starring point guard who was on the cover of Sports Illustrated two weeks in a row. A quicker-than-expected return from knee surgery would be heavily hyped with the Knicks down two point guards and facing elimination against LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and the Heat. But Lin just may not be ready to attempt it.

There is a bit of a catch. To get the app to work, cars have to have Chevrolet's MyLink touch screen system, which is coming out in new models. GM would not say how much MyLink would cost. It comes standard on some more costly models but is an option on lower-level models.
"One day my brother Randy started limping and he was in perfect health," said Carl Cadonau Jr., co-president of Alpenrose. "When he was diagnosed, we started to become involved right after that.

In Tustin, some $215 million of “must pay” redevelopment obligations were called into question – including loans between the city and its redevelopment agency (which are essentially the same thing), according to documents from the Department of Finance. Critics have said such loans were one way cities pulled money out of one pocket and put it into another, and it's something the department is on the prowl for. Tustin has submitted a revised list to the state, which is now being reviewed.
The university recovered the following year, landing former U.S. Atty. Gen Janet Reno for the 2001 commencement. But in 2002, the university trotted out Olympic gold-medalist skier Jonny Mosely (who at the time didn't have a bachelor's degree) to speak to graduating seniors, sparking popular rumors that UC Berkeley was campus non grata for anyone who had any hopes of seeking elected office. But UC Berkeley again came back with news anchor Ted Koppel and Jihad vs. McWorld author Benjamin Barber the next two years.
So, too, must safety issues associated with an overused grass field, said White, who says recent injuries were caused by poor field conditions.
Thumping techno, a doorman at almost every pass, whimsical topiary animals, strategically placed sculptural chairs and experimental looped films greeted us as we made our way up to the open air rooftop bar, complete with an infinity pool and private waterbed pods. The view was stunning -- of the famed Spanish revival Los Angeles Central Library and I.M. Pei's breathtaking cylindrical U.S. Bank Tower high-rise -- and the bikini- and tattoo-clad partiers on the dance floor.

For example, federal timber payments to rural counties, considered crucial to the financial viability of those communities, expired when Republicans controlled the Senate, the House and the White House. Even though Smith says preserving the program is a high priority and rural voters are one of his core constituencies, no bill got out of committee to extend the payments until Democrats regained control of Congress.
Many European business leaders would second that notion, as demand evaporates in their home markets. The latest purchasing managers' index, an indicator of business activity from market-research firm Markit, showed Monday that the April figure for the euro zone's private sector contracted at its sharpest rate since November, suggesting the region's economic decline since last autumn might be steepening. And first-quarter earnings reports from European manufacturers—from car companies to electronics and energy giants— continue to show falling demand in Europe.
Big Ten leader Purdue (30-5, 11-3) had its 10-game winning streak snapped Saturday in an 8-5 loss to host Nebraska (26-14, 8-6). Kevin Plawecki (Westfield) was 3-for-5 with two RBIs for the Boilermakers. Cameron Perkins (Southport) homered twice Friday in Purdue's 8-5 win over the Cornhuskers.

I do admire the manner in which Vanity Fair has enhanced Colacello's article with gorgeous photos that even I, an old-timer, have never seen before. The Duchess of Windsor, prominent, leaving La Cote Basque with the elegant C-Z Guest right behind her, ghostly gray and wearing a hat. These contrast with an urbane Truman Capote and his then pal Lee Radziwill, both wearing shades, exiting The Colony restaurant together. (We get some other glimpses of attentive men over the years -- Jerome Zipkin, Glenn Birnbaum, Kenny Jay Lane, Bill Paley, Irving "Swifty" Lazar, Roy Cohn, Norman Parkinson.)

The AP and UPI honored the Big Buck for leading the Lions to a franchise-record 12 victories (and a playoff win over Dallas).
The action is, admitted, pretty amazing. Star Iko Uwais is lithe and acrobatic, and the martial arts on display involve not only the usual karate chops to the carotid artery and high kicks to the head but more knives than you’ll see on a late-night infomercial. It’s all extremely loud, violent and intense.
The Centerfield Street area is where most people will start when arriving at the stadium, so you won't be surprised to know that it's home to the Trop's flagship bar, the Brewhouse. The Brewhouse is a large, brewpub-style bar and restaurant that fills up within minutes after the main doors open. The large bar in the center is home to a dozen or so draft beers, several bottled beers (including quality micros) and a full liquor bar. We grabbed a quick cocktail and moved along.

On the other hand, the new 3-D "Titanic" does remind us that Cameron knows how to fill a screen. The movie (like "Avatar") loses a great deal on television, even on home theater systems. Cameron likes working on an epic scale that can best be appreciated in theaters, where his grand themes and "top of the world" gestures play better. The central love story involving steerage passenger Leonardo DiCaprio and rich girl Kate Winslet has lost none of its luster - metaphorically speaking.

Jon Corzine's administration: Cutting energy use by 20 percent by 2020; providing 20 percent of the state's electricity through renewable energy such as wind and solar power; and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. New Jersey currently gets about 2 percent of its energy from renewable sources.

And I don't know about you, but there's something about that sentence fragment that feels a whole lot like Christmastime.

Too often bipartisanship is equated with centrism or deal cutting. Bipartisanship is not the opposite of principle. One can be very conservative or very liberal and still have a bipartisan mindset. Such a mindset acknowledges that the other party is also patriotic and may have some good ideas. It acknowledges that national unity is important, and that aggressive partisanship deepens cynicism, sharpens political vendettas, and depletes the national reserve of good will that is critical to our survival in hard times. Certainly this was understood by President Reagan, who worked with Democrats frequently and showed flexibility that would be ridiculed today  from assenting to tax increases in the 1983 Social Security fix, to compromising on landmark tax reform legislation in 1986, to advancing arms control agreements in his second term.
The twists and turns of the "Pirates" plot are many, but hanging on for the duration is a pleasure. The visual treats are many, including random signage ("Live Sports: Urchin Throwing, Cockney Baiting" reads one) and a clever riff on movie maps that illustrate nautical progress.
Bernanke said the Fed was trying to get the weak economy moving and that raising interest rates could trigger a recession, which would hurt all investors.

Questions like these will be explored through presentations, close readings, conversation and creative exercises. Although not required, participants are encouraged to bring their own work, as well as favorite works by others.

If the shell presentation does not appeal to you, and if you plan to warm the lobster meat in gratin dishes, discard the heads. Twist off the claws as above. Hold each tail flat and twist away the fan-shaped pieces at the bottom narrow end. You can use your finger to push the tail meat out of the larger end. Or you can use sharp kitchen scissors to cut through the soft inner part of the shell (not the round part) to release the tail meat. Cut the tail meat in half lengthwise and then cut away the intestinal vein. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.
By that measure, the signs are good.

Some of our leaders have decided that dismantling the American Dream is the answer to our economic troubles. They say we can no longer afford to let homeowners deduct from their taxes the mortgage interest they pay. Some say homeowners, instead of investing the proceeds from the sale of their home in a new home, should be forced to give part of their hard-earned profits to Uncle Sam. They even think we should end the policy of government support for programs that made home mortgages affordable to the average family. They say these programs, which have served our country well for generations, should be abandoned in the name of fiscal responsibility.
Santa Ana Unified officials say they hope to trim 131 teaching jobs through the combination of temporary teacher cuts and by offering early retirement incentives of up to $10,000 to other senior teachers.

It makes me wonder if congregational hoarding keeps us from discovering the ministries God intends for us. Have our ministries have become so cluttered with programs that no longer work, ideas that are obsolete, and ways of being in touch with our community that do not meet real needs? Where do we need to change?
Janet Lister, a 28-year-old stay-at-home mom, heard her voice crack as she told the students how Ethan was diagnosed eight months earlier. She did not tell them about the mounting medical bills or how her husband was laid off from his plumber's job for three weeks. She did not say no mom should have to watch a son endure the side effects of chemotherapy -- vomiting, headaches, mouth sores. She did not tell the teens that she waits until she puts her three kids to bed before she sits on the couch some nights and sobs.

The Sporting News article goes on to detail how elite players at UF were rarely punished despite serious allegations. Among the most troubling of the incidents came in 2008 when star wide receiver Percy Harvin allegedly went unpunished after he physically assaulted Billy Gonzalez, who was then his position coach at UF. According to the story, Harvin ended up "grabbing (Gonzalez) by the neck and throwing him to the ground. Harvin had to be pulled off Gonzales by two assistant coaches-but was never disciplined."

The Brewers tapped around Garcia in the top of the sixth to not only tie the game but take the lead. Jonathan Lucroy had the most-damaging hit -- a two-out double off the left-field wall that scored two and broke a 1-1 tie. Garcia continues to carry the reputation of a young pitcher who can be undone by a hiccup. He has worked so far this season to control innings, to maintain poise, and there were times in each of his first couple starts this season that showed progress. The mistake on the bases that led to the mishaps on the mound were similar to starts he had last season with a play not made behind him or a call not given him at the plate would flick a domino run of trouble for the lefty.

The administration and many in Congress seem to view defense as an easy target for across-the-board reductions. Gates is waging his final war against such abstraction. Decisions on defense spending, in his view, must be based on strategy, not on budget mathematics. "Right now, the process is just the reverse," he argues. "Everybody's doing math and not strategy."

3Highball glass: If the drink requires a straw, it requires a tall glass. The highball (or the collins, which is narrower and doesn't hold as much liquid) can hold anything carbonated over ice, and is especially useful for drinks with muddled ingredients like mint and fruit. A pint glass is an OK substitute but the smaller surface of the highball does a better job concentrating the fizz of carbonated beverages and the aromas of garnish, like cucumber in your Pimm's Cup and celery in your Bloody Mary. A great, affordable pick is the Strauss Cooler ($3.95 at Crate & Barrel).

The Lyon B-25 was not on the raid – none of those planes came back and none were intended to, an important part of the story. Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle and 79 other fliers took off from the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Hornet knowing they didn't have fuel to make it back.

"I wish to express the most sincere thanks to the Cleveland Veterinary Referral Service, specifically Dr. Vogt, Dr. Boyce, Dr. Crandall and Amy Moore. I have been living through every pet owner's worst nightmare. My dog is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatments after a very successful operation performed by Dr. Vogt.

The Mets? Yes, there is a blue-collar elegance to the Mets, and New York is nothing if not a town of dreamers, and the Mets have satisfied that itch often. But even when the Mets were prosperous they enjoyed the notion that they were lovable underdogs and, let’s be honest: New York City will never be considered an underdog by anybody -- not London, not Paris, not Rome or Tokyo or Beijing or Moscow -- and “lovable” should be reserved for Green Bay or Minneapolis or Milwaukee.

Roggeveen, like today's visitors, was mesmerized by the island's remarkable ancient culture, especially the moai. He was "struck with astonishment" at the sophistication of the statues and was puzzled as to how they could have been transported: "We could not comprehend how it was possible that these people, who are devoid of heavy thick timber for making any machines, as well as strong ropes, nevertheless had been able to erect such images, which were fully 30 feet high, and thick in proportion."
In any case, updates are out of the question. "Birdie" satirizes the hoopla that ensued when Elvis Presley was drafted in 1957. In the show, the draft notice goes to teen heartthrob Conrad Birdie (Parker Pogue, who's terrific).

It had been rewritten hastily overnight to say that before any additional increase in the debt limit could take place, Congress must approve a balanced budget-amendment to the Constitution and send it to the states for ratification.

And that ricotta gnocchi with veal Bolognese ($18)? Not as good as our Fascino memory (could it have been the white tablecloths?), but so wispy and cloud-like that it almost seems unfair to call it gnocchi at all — to lump it with all those heavy potato-based pastas.
Marcella said he's frustrated the department overruled the advisory group's proposal. Medical-marijuana advocates plan to show up en masse at today's rulemaking hearing to protest the proposed regulations, which would also prohibit caregivers from joining together to form cooperatives and would limit how often patients can switch caregivers.

Over the years, he worked as a trapper, translator and guide, and developed a reputation as a crack shot with a powerful fondness for whiskey.

Norman Chad, Washington Post: "Who really is watching the NHL postseason? Ratings are way up this year, yet at any given time, twice as many people are watching ‘The Real Housewives of Atlanta' reunion show on Bravo than watching the NHL playoffs on NBC Sports Network. Heck, most prison TVs will put ‘Storage Wars' on before they put on a Predators-Coyotes game."

In 2011 the U.S. became a net exporter of petroleum (TIME magazine, March 26, 2012). Unlike the beliefs of our brainy presidential candidates, pumping more oil is not going to lower the price of gasoline. Oil is a commodity that is vulnerable to price spikes caused not only by supply and demand but by just about any geo-political concerns that pop up. Demand from growing economies like China, India and other emerging markets is behind the current high price of oil as well as Iran's belligerence toward the West.
It's tempting to see his Yorkshire paintings — with their attention to the changing seasons, the cycle of life and death — as a natural progression for a septuagenarian artist, a suggestion he doesn't deny.

And they tend to be leaner than meat-eaters.

Finally, the proposed code requires a chief legal officer to carry out the board's duties, to conduct investigations and to provide due process for all received complaints.

Trim nails Keep nails short so they won't curve into the skin or allow infection-causing bacteria to gather beneath them.

Use industrial-strength nail cutters, since wimpy ones will split nails.

Chicken isn't roasted, sauteed or pan fried; it's broiled ($17.95), a simple preparation you might do at home.

The "Exiles" in Cary Groner's debut novel are cardiologist Peter Scanlon and his daughter, Alex. They move to Nepal only to find that the job Peter expected to find has fallen through. He ends up working for Physicians Without Frontiers out of Kathmandu. Insurgency in the countryside is moving ever closer, and one of the doctors gives him a warning.

Even as the fighting intensifies, Peter and Alex fly into the mountains to treat a pair of climbers, only to be taken by the guerillas.

Workers are hired with the knowledge that there will be few, if any, opportunities for advancement, even though they will be expected to continue to upgrade their skills, mostly on their own time and at their own expense. They know that they may be let go for no reason for the first few years of their assignment, must go without a paycheck for several months a year, and cannot take a vacation except during that time of unemployment. There are constant interruptions while they are working, and every year or two, the product description changes, but they are expected to make the same high-quality product, regardless of whether the raw materials are broken, the wrong size or even missing. The equipment they must use is often broken, outdated or missing. The workers are often required to work overtime, but are not paid extra.

Send his favorite pj's and security object with him, then follow through with your promise. (Don't be too surprised if your child is fast asleep when you arrive for pick up).

As Moore fell, Bertuzzi drove Moore's face into the ice and landed on top of Moore, along with one Avs player and one Canuck. The hit and the pileup gave Moore three fractured neck vertebrae and a concussion. The NHL suspended Bertuzzi for the remainder of the regular season and the playoffs, and the ban was extended internationally during the NHL lockout of 2004-05. He was reinstated for the 2005-06 season.
For two years, the St. Louis County Port Authority, the Lemay Community Center Advisory Committee and residents came together for public meetings. A lot of ideas were exchanged.
Perira said Torres had recently rented out a room in her apartment in March and was happy to have found a boarder to help her defray expenses. But Perira said he’d never met the person who had moved in to the first-floor apartment of the three-story rowhouse with gray-and-white siding. Perira said he learned Calero was the second victim only after police showed him a photo.
In some ways, Grebel sees himself as a movie director at NJIT: his students are the actors and the technical scrawlings on the whiteboard are scripts.
Federal authorities accuse Conour, 64, of committing wire fraud in defrauding clients from December 2000 to March 2012 by using newly obtained settlement funds to pay old settlements and debts.
It's twice as nice at home
The memorial on the side of Steve Reynolds Boulevard took shape on soil littered with pieces of Wideman’s Trailblazer. People left flowers, and someone tied a Mylar smiley balloon to a rail closest to the spot where Wideman’s SUV finally stopped. The tributes stand in colorful contrast to the blacktop where a life ended.

And at worst? Well, at one point our lovely couple is driving along when the heroine accuses our hero of passing gas. He reluctantly admits to it. At which point she rolls up her window to show her unconditional acceptance or something, which he proclaims an extraordinarily “romantic” gesture.
Or is the leader a ruputed member of a hate group?
They didn't have much problem against Hochevar.
Back on the mainland, we continue east past the quirky Accordion Museum, then stop for samples at a traditional apple cider maker in Cap-St.-Ignace. Chiming church bells usher us into L'Islet-sur-Mer, another official beauty spot with a popular maritime museum, where we order Middle Eastern- and Asian-influenced tapas on a deck overlooking the river at La Salicorne Café. By now, we've learned that even fast food places using local ingredients are identified with a red Arrêt Gourmand sign. We are never disappointed.
Perhaps the best-known examples are subscription-based online retailers such as Los Angeles' ShoeDazzle and Santa Monica's BeachMint's StyleMint, JewelMint, ShoeMint and BeautyMint, which offer shoppers access to personalized "showrooms" of merchandise for flat monthly fees charged whether shoppers decide to buy or not. Celebrity tie-ins are often involved: ShoeDazzle charges $39.95 for monthly access to shoes and handbags endorsed by Kim Kardashian, while StyleMint customers pay $29.99 for a choice of T-shirts vetted by the Olsen twins. New York's Birchbox offers monthly deliveries of sample-size beauty products packaged in a signature pink box.

My company believes that by investing in quality education, we can help prepare young Americans for the competitive world of a global economy. The GE Foundation’s Developing Futures in Education program invested $22 million in Atlanta Public Schools because we saw progress and wanted to accelerate it. The progress has been considerable:
Roam delivers good value, but I must say the burger prices can send the eyebrows up. The elk burger runs $18 — OK, game meat and all that — but a basic beef burger costs $16. Even a veggie burger is $15. Those are Manhattan prices, and seem out of line with the rest of the menu.
A court hearing was held in March to discuss the final effort to preserve his license, and Midei said afterward that he felt "optimistic."

NEARK -- Nineteen men, including the owner of an Edison pharmacy, are in federal custody and authorities said today they are searching for three more accused drug dealers involved in illegal sales of the prescription drug, Oxycodone, that brought an illicit New Jersey drug network about $1 million a month.
To me, there are two x-factors for the Ducks: The first is Carlos Emory. If the Ducks have any hope of making the NCAA tournament and then making any sort of run in it, Emory will need to continue to give them important minutes off the bench. When he is playing well, he is a matchup nightmare, which is a huge advantage for Oregon. Devoe Joseph has also been terrific as of late, and seems intent on putting this team on his back and carrying them to wins. He needs to keep that up -- and still take smart shots -- for Oregon to win three games here.
"I wasn't making many shots, but I wasn't taking that many either," said Ginobili, who was 0 for 8 from 3-point range in the first three games but had three 3s Monday and finished with a team-high 17 points. "I really wasn't that worried. I was happy that the team was playing as well as we were. We were 3-0 and winning those games with authority."

Hollie Cavanagh, "Bleeding Love:" Now it's time for the British portion of the evening, and Hollie opts for "Bleeding Love" from U.K. "X Factor" winner Leona Lewis. She reworks the arrangement and slows it down. The song has a darker, bluesier vibe than the hit, and Hollie makes a smart choice to sing it from atop the piano, where she sits very still, which only emphasizes the emotion and maturity in her vocal. She is two for two tonight.
Robinson, who measured in at 6-4, 264 pounds, is a player who didn't have much production in college (12 receptions last season) but he had a tremendous spring, running in the 4.5s for his 40-yard dash. He showed plenty of athleticism to obviously catch the eye of Giants' scouts. The team brought him in for a pre-draft visit.
Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat, has twice sought similar statewide requirements, but they did not become law. Her previous attempts included fines of $50 or $100 for parents who do not attend, but the legislation just introduced, which would apply only to Cleveland, does not spell out any punishment.
Rory Little, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, said the Supreme Court is unlikely to review the case because Thursday's ruling is the third appellate court decision upholding the pledge.

Berry won in a wind-legal time of 21.10, and Kent was second in 21.26. They're both entered in Saturday's 400. That could be fun. The meet resumes at 10 a.m.
Many readers find these stories fascinating, but some have wondered noisily why the newspaper would bother with a 40-year-old case that seemed settled long ago. I'll plead guilty, as a Kent alumnus who was there at the time, to being fascinated with the subject. But Mangels doesn't have my connection: He was an 11-year-old Florida sixth-grader in 1970, and didn't have any particular interest in the shootings until the tape fairly dropped into his lap last April while he was working on a 40th anniversary story.

Peter Sterling, general counsel for the public defender system, said its St. Louis County office worked at 160 percent of its capacity in June. He promised to provide details before moving forward with a shutdown, and said he believes prosecutors will come to see his side.
But the studio's hands were tied when it came to promoting the film's stars, who did only a handful of television appearances as they, and their superiors, want to protect the SEALs' identity as much as possible, in keeping with their code of anonymity.
Our friends had moved to this northern German city because the mother had accepted a teaching job. She and her son would be at the same bilingual school, and neither of them had seen it, so we decided to check it out. Part of the walk was along the Berlin Wall, another landmark whose significance was lost on the kids who saw it only as an endless canvas for street art.
The uncertainty about how much Mets co-owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz ultimately must give up has damaged the team’s financial picture, forcing it to slash payroll and try to raise tens of millions of dollars by selling small chunks of the team, though Wilpon, the Mets’ chief executive, said several weeks ago the current owners plan to keep the franchise “for a very long time.”
Officials have said they hoped that many of the parks could be taken over by municipalities or the state. In addition to the park closures, Dooley and his administrators have recommended job cuts, an increase in fees for construction permits and scaling back snow removal.

"If it makes it easier, I think that's going to mean fewer people on the road commuting," said Elizabeth Hazel, a 32-year-old Hampden woman who said she uses the trails recreationally. "It also just makes the city a nicer place to live — it just increases the livability of the city."
"Unlike a street dealer, defendant well understood the effects of the poison he peddled," wrote Assistant U.S. Attys. Ariel A. Neuman and Benjamin R. Barron.

Underwater surveys show two large chunks of the ship's iron-armored siding have survived, the largest being 68 feet long and 24 feet tall. Raising them intact will be a priority. Researchers also spotted three cannons on the riverbed, an intact propeller and other pieces of the warship's steam engines. And there's smaller debris scattered across the site that could yield unexpected treasures, requiring careful sifting beneath 40 feet of water.
Dinners, too, are not what they seem. The oddly named chicken tartufo ($26) is a version of saltimbocca, the tender chicken in a bold circle of sweet marsala sauce (a bit of truffle, too), topped with melted mozzarella and prosciutto, sprinkled with mushrooms and decorated with a few spikes of impossibly flavorful asparagus.
USC won 26 NCAA men's outdoor track and field championships between 1926-76.
"I see where it could've been my fault to not follow up," Rolley told an investigator. "Am I kicking myself now that I didn't do it? Of course. I wouldn't be in this situation."
In fact, Missouri's experience proves why it is a bad idea to involve judges. The judges decided to act in secret, arguing that they were performing a judicial task, not a political one. That's a specious argument, but even if it were true, the final result lacks a key element of most judicial rulings: an explanation.
For the new school in Indianapolis, Ogston hopes to recruit students from a 3- to 5-mile radius of the building. If the number of applicants exceeds the school's 300-student capacity, officials will use a lottery system to determine who may enroll.

I think I hear a new cable channel series in the making.
Felton entered the game with 3:48 left in the first and came out firing, making his first three shots, all from three-point range, and scoring nine quick points.
Segel, who's got lovable schlub down to a science, and Adams, not quite as enchanting as she was as the fairy tale princess in 2007's "Enchanted," but close enough, are perfectly cast. They are completely at ease in a world filled with Muppets and Muppet problems, and totally game for the huge musical numbers.
Friends of Theresa Rockwood said she told them her brother had a caseworker and a doctor at Cascadia. Cascadia officials declined to discuss the case, citing federal privacy laws.
Jared Sullinger has power and sure hands. He stole a hard inbounds pass from Gary Bell Jr. under his own basket only inches from Bell's hands and turned it into a conventional 3-point play by Craft. Buford floats into a shot that is so silky you can sense the shimmer of his touch. Thomas in the lane is caged power and urgency. Twice he lost the ball in the early going, while fighting inside shots up against double teams.
Lindo McCleur, who served for more than a decade in the Air Force's Judge Advocate General's office, said she suspects that some problems arise because military officials simply want to protect the privacy of individuals.

It takes far more political skill to speak up for the still-unknowable future, for the messy process that clears away declining companies, allowing capital to migrate to enterprises that deliver the wealth creation and productivity we need to prosper.
Meanwhile in the East, a ridge of high pressure would continue pushing a front southward down the East Coast. This front would move from the Great Lakes and into the Ohio River Valley and Mid-Atlantic states where it would produce widespread scattered showers. This front had not yet produced severe storms, but was likely to do so as it pushed southward and obtain more moisture from the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Heat advisories would remain in effect over the Southern Plains and Southeastern U.S. as highs remained in the 90s and high humidity pushed heat indicies over 100 degrees. Farther south, a tropical wave in the Gulf of Mexico had a low, 30 percent chance of tropical storm formation. The system would continue kicking up scattered showers and thunderstorms over Florida and the Florida Keys, as well as the rest of the Gulf states as it moved northwestward throughout the day.

How Do We Go?: Penitently, as sinning L.A. swinger Mimi Rogers realizes she needs to get back to God before it’s too late. Interestingly, this is a rare mainstream movie attempt to treat the situation as more than just a horror-movie gimmick — the end is now, and it’s for real.
For the most part, the Disney cruise regulars I spoke to marveled at the Dream, calling it bigger, brighter and better than its older cousins, with many more bells and whistles.

"We had a loan invested in the Coliseum Building and lost that when it was foreclosed on," she said. "The big concern is not wanting a key building like that to become a blight in the neighborhood. We've been through the foreclosure and bank owning it and that hasn't seemed to happen."
In your case, both the dogs and the kids need to learn respect for each other and each other's belongings. Use positive reinforcement during the parenting and training sessions to ensure the acceptable behavior you desire. It may take a little time, but by constantly scrutinizing and correcting who does what when, and perhaps offering something else in its place, the kids and dogs will learn what you expect of them.

He got his wish. He'll be paired with leader Peter Hanson, a Swede who is a stroke ahead of Mickelson at 9-under-par 207 and braced for what he knows will be a Phil lovefest. And he's OK with that.
It was the subsequent increase in the debt ceiling that gave rise to the 12-member supercommittee charged with coming up with a plan to cut the deficit by $1.2 trillion over 10 years by Thanksgiving week. Its failure is supposed to trigger automatic cuts in 2013. But, as with Simpson-Bowles and the Obama-Boehner efforts, the supercommittee generated nothing for constituents to use in holding their members accountable.
Detroiters are still standing obediently in lines. They have learned that to survive and to receive any benefits at all, one stands in line and waits. Those who get out of line, just as in school, are usually punished in one way or another. But maybe now is the time to get out of line, or to line up across the path instead of nicely keeping to the right.

Nothing short of a full endorsement of both issues will satisfy many conservatives as they consider the Republican presidential field.

"Countdown," Olbermann's show, was canceled Friday and was to be replaced by another featuring former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer. In a statement, Gore, the former vice president and Nobel laureate, and his business partner Joel Hyatt took an extraordinary swipe at their outspoken host, to whom they had reportedly given a $10-million paycheck as well as an ownership stake in hopes he would raise the tiny network's profile.

The Salt River has had water releases for three years in a row, an unusual occurrance in itself, he said. But before the bladder burst, the last time there was a huge amount of water in the riverbottom was in 1993 and 1995.

But White Bird also runs a small, nervy second season of more intimate and often more experimental shows. Its "Uncaged" series is partly about the pleasures of the unexpected, and one of the fun things about following this season's lineup has been jumping around the city from spot to spot, seeing dance in places it doesn't usually happen.
The monument idea was quickly shelved, but in 2006 a reunion of resisters was staged (with Doukhobor help) in nearby Castlegar.

"I've counseled clients to use writing as a therapeutic tool -- to write a letter expressing what seem like overwhelming feelings of any kind -- whether you intend to send it or not," Nesbit wrote in an e-mail. Hooper said she believes the website offers comfort to readers, too, who might be in similar situations.
Unlike the Chechen insurgency, the one in Dagestan has not exploded into full-fledged war. Most of the attacks get little or no attention in Russian news media, making it an almost-forgotten conflict.
"In the beginning, I was a bit unsettled when I met Zach," said Veach's engineer, Scott Graves. "I was used to working with older, experienced drivers. But here he was and he looked much younger than his age. But now, I think of him as a race-car driver. I don't think of him as a child. He doesn't act like a child."
Democrats immediately celebrated the jury's verdict.

That problem is how the rules of political engagement have changed for the worse. The change was sparked partly by the new media world, where every sentence and procedural vote can trigger a national reaction instantly.
The day we took the train we spent the morning exploring the town, then hiked a 2-mile trail that meanders in and out of the woods that encircle the lush green Whistler resort golf course. The highlight was spotting a black bear, totally absorbed in thrashing around in the berry bushes that lined the 14th tee. We made it back to the hotel by midafternoon, in time to be picked up by the courtesy shuttle bus and delivered to the Whistler train depot for our reverse route on the "Sea to Sky Climb."

In 1995 under AFDC, a qualifying below-poverty single-parent Missouri family with two children could receive a monthly benefit of $292. In July 2011 under TANF, a comparable Missouri family could receive the same: $292. Adjusted for 15 years of inflation, that's a decrease of 29.8 percent, according to a study released
Too many, as it turned out.
His backers continued to seethe at the tens of millions of dollars in negative advertising from Restore Our Future, a Romney-aligned super PAC that helped torpedo Gingrich’s chances in Iowa and Florida when he could have seized control of the race. The view has not earned him a lot of sympathy.

In the 145-minute film, Bale plays John Miller, a carpetbagging American mortician looking to make a quick buck in China as the Japanese invade the city of Nanjing in 1937. When he holes up in a Catholic boarding school where teenage students and prostitutes have taken refuge from the fighting, Miller suddenly finds himself responsible for their welfare. As the horrors of the war close in — a Japanese commander, for instance, demands that the girls "sing" for officers at a military parade, code for rape — Miller is given a crash course in atrocities as well as his own capacity for sacrifice.
Abject failure is OK with him.

Bit of waterfront history
Just a few miles up the road from Woodloch Pines is The Lodge at Woodloch. Children are pretty much out of the picture here. This is the home of the spa and spa treatments are for those 16 and older. Parents without their kids, newlyweds, and even some singles are seen hiking the trails, taking exercise classes and dining at Tree, the spa's restaurant that serves healthy and tasty meals. Kids' items like chicken fingers and mac 'n' cheese are not on the menu.

Jim: When turning right onto First Capitol Drive (Route 94) from westbound I-70's offramp in St. Charles, unless you're paying close attention, you'll turn directly into a QuikTrip. There are minimal signs (if any) and many people don't realize this until the last second, which causes them to stop in the middle of the road and wait for an out. Could there be more signage, or could the lane be extended past the QT to avoid this. It's almost like MoDOT and QT planned this - kind of like an "exit through the gift shop" scenario at Disneyland.
"In fact, the numbers have been increasing," she said, adding that "out of 65 countries where reliable trend data is available, only three (Croatia, Euador and Estonia) show a significant reduction" from 1990 to 2010.

His unexciting exploits kept making me wish that I was re-watching “Raiders of the Lost Ark’’ or “Avatar’’ — two other classics ineptly aped by “John Carter.’’ Instead, I was enduring a movie even more soul-sucking than “The Phantom Menace.’’
While it is odd to say, given the talent they have, if I had to choose I would go with the San Jose Sharks as the most favorable matchup. The Blues dominated the season series with the Sharks. If they are healthy, the Blues have enough speed to cause problems for San Jose. Sharks goaltender Antti Niemi has won a Stanley Cup, but I would rather take my chances with him than with Quick.
Church officials said the last day for those interested in donating items is April 1 and the last day for those affected by the fire to pick up any items is April 2.

In November, someone whose heart may be two sizes too small vandalized the Honolulu park where the annual Makiki Mele Kalikimaka celebration is held, forcing the cancellation this year of the popular community event. Fortunately, the traditional Honolulu City Lights festivities will be fully powered, starting Dec. 3 with the Public Workers Electric Light Parade and opening night ceremonies at Honolulu Hale (a.k.a. City Hall), which includes a free concert by top island acts at 7:30 p.m. Elaborately decorated Christmas trees, a Christmas wreath contest, the city's own 50-foot "holiday tree" and numerous illuminated displays will remain on view through Christmas, with free milk and cookies Dec. 16, a free showing of "The Wizard of Oz" Dec. 17, and free hot chocolate Thursday and Friday nights through Dec. 23.
Under the current system, the Legislature funds a variety of budgets for different levels and parts of education such as public schools, education service districts and community colleges, said Duncan Wyse, president of the Oregon Business Council and leader of the governor's budget redesign team. These budgets have no focus on outcomes and create perverse incentives, he said.

Drought causes serious problems, but even without drought the challenge still remains of meeting the increasing demand for fresh water all over the world. A 2010 report by the Water Resources Group, including the World Bank, estimated that the gap between water demand globally and a reliable supply could reach between 40 percent and 50 percent by 2030 because of the growing population, the impact of industrialization, and further spread of irrigated agriculture.
Combine chicken, cut vegetables, separated garlic cloves and bacon pieces in the container (the vegetables should help keep chicken pieces from touching). Add enough red wine - about 3 quarts - to cover all.
øIf you are just graduating and preparing to look for your first job, this is especially key. Because most likely you have little or no experience. Employers expect that. But experienced or not, employers are gauging how interested you are in the work, how you approach things, whether you can be trusted and how badly you want the job. That's why I picked Rhett. He had it all. And that's why they'd pick you.

My only aggravation is that 15-year-old Cheetah Boy seems to wait until the last minute every night and then throw one day's worth of clothes in the washer. I have asked him 8,012 times not to do this, but apparently his brain cannot think more than 24 hours ahead, unless it involves getting a drivers' license, in which case he can plan years in advance.

That's one reason the administration's explicit endorsement came as a happy surprise. Until now, the White House has expressed support for the wider use of electric vehicles but has basically ignored Merkley's idea. The White House has also focused on building support for a comprehensive energy policy. That effort has failed.

After discussion of the wage reforms, the operations committee turned its attention to transparency, with Foye acknowledging the agency had been criticized for excessive secrecy, sometimes with good reason. Officials said measures include a redrafting of the agency's public records policy, clarifying which records would be made available on request, with examples, and streamlining the appeals process when a request is denied.
The underground has an illustrious past to be sure: A web of Prohibition-era tunnels connecting houses of culture and commerce on one side of Main Street with businesses of lesser repute on the other. A stop on the Underground Railroad at the Quindaro Ruins. The Eighth Street tunnel where streetcar passengers chugged through red-painted brick walls beneath the Quality Hill bluff from 1888 to 1956.

These days, the Twins can't seem to get Hunter out. He has a 13-game hitting streak against his former team and had four RBI hits in the first two games of this week's series, including two home runs. When the Angels threatened in the fifth inning Tuesday, the Twins pitched to Albert Pujols with an open base before intentionally walking Hunter -- now that's respect.

It would have been a shutout had not Cliff Harris decided to field a punt inside his own five, making an over-the-shoulder grab heading into the end zone. He was tackled there for a safety.
A story I wrote for Sunday’s Tribune reports on a small but outspoken group of advocates who are pushing for more data on the risks of giving away a kidney while alive. These living donors have created their own websites and organizations, spoken out on Internet message boards and participated on government advisory groups, giving voice to a group of givers who don’t always feel comfortable talking about problems they have endured as the result of doing a good deed.
It's as simple as that for the Blazers, thanks to New Orleans' two-game slide.

Can we be partners in assisting someone who may need help when that same person has proven himself over the years as a partner, a reliable and efficient employee?"
"It's state law, but I feel it's unconstitutional, it's un-American," Kilbane said in an interview. "They're purging honest, hardworking people from the political process. I'm a tradesman. What kind of bias am I going to display? I work on bridges."

After graduating from South High School, Nelson was drafted into the Army. He served about a year and a half in Europe during World War II in the advanced infantry and military police before he was allowed to go home because his father had died and he had to take care of his family.
Religious zealotry is alien to me - that's why I enjoyed Lightman's thoughtful, generally light touch - but I understand that lots of people are fired up by their own creeds, and hot to impose them upon anybody and everybody, eagerly using any tool at their disposal, from little tracts left in bus station restrooms to fanciful doctrine jammed into public education disguised as legitimate science.
As the story jumps from set-piece to set-piece, one monster to the next, there is no sense of ongoing adventure, just a checklist being ticked off. The mythology of the ancient Greeks is ultimately no match for the industrial imperatives of modern Hollywood.

The American Cancer Society, American Heart Association and American Lung Association wrote Proposition 29, the measure on the June 5 ballot to increase California's cigarette tax by $1 to $1.87 per pack. Lung Association President Jane Warner likes to emphasize the demarcation at play: She's with the good guys, while the bad guys, Big Tobacco, will spend buckets more money trying to fight the measure than her groups will spend trying to pass it.
As a result, contractors have been forced to choose between meeting payroll, compensating suppliers or making good on their obligations to union benefit plans.
Chute fractures her strong prose, fragmenting sentences and splintering the point of view. The book reads like a play for many voices, including that of the planet Pluto and a petulant TV. Icons in the text signal who's talking when, and a catalog of characters helps keep the speakers straight.
With Pressey sidelined by his third foul, Denmon made two of three free throws after being fouled outside the arc to make it 49-46 – MU's biggest lead to that point. But as Norfolk State had done all game, it came right back after a Mizzou move, this time tying it on a Chris McEachin 3.

To join the People-Animal Connection, volunteers have to take a people-only workshop and then be evaluated with their dogs on 24 exercises. "You either pass or you don't," Barron says. The activities may sound simple enough, but not every dog-human combo is cut out for them. "People tell me, 'My dog would be perfect,'" Barron says. "So I ask, 'How many times have you been in an intensive care pediatric unit? How will your dog react? How will you react?'"

Why do smart people love seemingly mindless games? Angry Birds is one of the latest to join the pantheon of "casual games" that have appealed to a mass audience with a blend of addictive game play, memorable design and deft marketing. The games are designed to be played in short bursts, sometimes called "entertainment snacking" by industry executives, and there is no stigma attached to adults pulling out their mobile phones and playing in most places. Games like Angry Birds incorporate cute, warm graphics, amusing sound effects and a reward system to make players feel good. A scientific study from 2008 found that casual games provide a "cognitive distraction" that could significantly improve players' moods and stress levels.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Benedict Van of collecting $7 million from investors for two Web-based start-up companies he founded called hereUare and eCity.

But Ready apparently was trying to re-enter politics this year and had formed a committee to seek the Democratic nomination for sheriff in Pinal County.
Outlook: Crennel said last month he wants help on defense, and there are two glaring needs: middle linebacker and tackle. Kuechly would pair well with Derrick Johnson in middle of defense. Two other potential picks are Memphis DT Poe and LSU DT Michael Brockers. If GM Scott Pioli is to further improve one of NFL's worst offenses, look for Kansas City to select OG David DeCastro from Stanford or Tannehill.

Verdict: This matchup needs to happen. It would be competitive. It would be chippy. And more importanty, it would captivate L.A. Should this series take place, the Lakers would have the clear advantage. DeAndre Jordan can't guard Bynum. An array of double teams (and certainly Randy Foye) cannot slow Bryant. And the Clippers obsession with highlight reels will keep it exciting, but will distract them from their actual focus.
You can't simply throw it away. (You wouldn't toss out an old friend, right?)

His paintings at Leopold range from narrative landscapes with low horizons and expansive skies to more abstract, minimal compositions.

MADRID — The Spanish government's decision to take control of the country's fourth-largest bank highlights the problem gripping the nation's financial system.

Sanfilippo's has been a fixture on North Broadway downtown for more than 20 years. Late last year he opened a spinoff in the Chesterfield Valley, serving an abbreviated form of the downtown menu in a smaller space.

SOPA and PIPA also prohibits any technologies that can successfully be used to interfere with the application of the blacklist. So an anonymity tool like Tor becomes a big problem; it masks the IP address of the original source and hides the trail between a series of intermediate anonymous hops. Tor is popularly used by oppressed groups worldwide to safely speak out against local corruption and violence. Its users aren't trying to hide from the MPAA . . . they're trying to conceal themselves from the local chief of police who'll likely kill them on sight for criticizing the government. Under SOPA/PIPA, none of that online traffic would make it into the U.S. with its anonymity intact.

--- Peter Schrager, FOX Sports: Peter Konz, C/G, Wisconsin. “With Ben Grubbs’ future unknown, the Ravens could have a bit of work to do on their offensive line this offseason.

Though the Ravens defense isn’t getting any younger, they’d be wise to draft Konz, another young, talented offensive lineman to protect Joe Flacco.”

Within a year, the paper was taking on weightier issues, covering Gay Alliance protests over discrimination in hiring, and relations with police. A front-page story in 1973 followed a municipal judge's decision that nude dancing was not illegal, and charges were dropped against the go-go boys at the Gaslight. When the gay Twin Peaks softball team bested the San Francisco Police Department team in 1974, the paper gleefully ran a banner front-page headline: "Police Beaten!"

David Vardy led the way overlaying California ingredients with a Japanese sensibility when he opened this Berkeley restaurant 22 years ago. Has it really been that long? It seems like only yesterday that he was the darling of the food world; now, more than two decades later, he's still going strong. Diners can enjoy noodles topped with roasted oysters, smoked trout or braised beef. But don't pass up the three main courses, and hope the pork shoulder is on the menu. The interior blends Craftsmen and Japanese elements to create a serene environment, with stucco walls etched with art and a willowy flower arrangement at the communal table at the entrance. At lunch, you can get bento box lunches.
But, as the Tate Museum notes, Gris was "Picasso's friend and neighbor." Other sources say Gris thought of him as a teacher. Gris, indeed, followed the development of the Cubist style and eventually made it his own. He created an "Homage to Picasso," which he exhibited in 1912.

Mercifully, that was the extent of the frivolousness that’s marred too many of the earlier debates.

But TSA employees say being granted collective bargaining rights is no small measure of respect for a notoriously low-paid workforce hounded by the media for every mishap and defied by cell-phone videographers warning "Don’t touch my junk."

By 2008, the judge presiding in Knopf's divorce indicated she owed business-related debts of nearly $71,000, including court awards to former clients and to the attorneys who represented her in the past.

Plan B: Look no farther than the next island over, St. Barthélemy, where wild and undeveloped Anse de Grande Saline is the solution for a beach lover's most sybaritic dreams.

But in her defense, it was a very hot day.
Ma, who was elected in 2006 and holds the leadership position of majority whip, said she did not know that the rules explicitly forbid voting for another member.

The good news is that these changes don't need to be monumental. You don't have to run a marathon or climb mountains. Walking 30 to 40 minutes a day and shedding a few extra pounds can fundamentally change your chances of developing diabetes.

For example, someone who weighs 200 pounds could potentially prevent diabetes by losing just 10 to 15 pounds.

Inspired by Mark Obmascik's nonfiction book, David Frankel's film observes the migratory patterns of three breeds of birders.

Or by President Obama, for that matter. Romney has been promoting “economic freedom” lately, but his definition of that phrase seems to have little in common with Paul’s.

2. If San Francisco ever wanted to stage a lube embargo and hold the nation hostage under threat of dry, chafing sex until our demands were met, we very well could. Here, you can find every lube imaginable in quality levels from Dom Perignon to Mumm's, and pick up a locally made designer vibrator or butt plug while you're at it. Visit the aforementioned Good Vibrations to experience our true San Francisco treat. Walgreens, which is practically on every corner in the city, has the cheapest condoms and lube in town, though while you'll be floored by the extensive selection of lube at the Castro Walgreens (498 Castro St.), sadly, all of it is bottom-shelf fare. For cheap lube (and more kinds than you'd ever imagine, including many high-quality brands), visit any of the adult stores in the Castro. There's always a lube price war going on in San Francisco, people, and many of these stores make the slippery stuff their loss leader. Take advantage. To get cheap vibrators, you'll find some in the boy-centric Castro shops, but the rock-bottom bargains and selection are in North Beach at "adult bookstores" such as Big Al's (556 Broadway) and Adult Media (Kearny and Clay).

Kassian addresses the Canucks well-documented need for toughness, but he's also a guy who can play in the playoffs and that is a huge factor. Getting Sami Pahlsson from the Columbus Blue Jackets gives them a third-line center who can still be an effective shut-down player and don't underestimate the possibility that Marc-Andre Gragnani could develop into an offensive force there."

While the first situation might conceivably lead to war — if the Iranian leadership were insane or suicidal, which they're not — the second option will definitely initiate a military chain reaction involving surrounding countries and the U.S. with unforeseen and devastating consequences.

Yet, the re-occurrence is lost on Elliott. Bring it up and he stares blanks at you, as if you just said something that made no sense, as if you tried to go five-hole with a medicine ball.

The Monkees were four actors and musicians specially assembled in 1966 to create a television sitcom about, appropriately, four young guys who are musicians.

About retirement benefits, CalPERS changed its rate of return, which means it will no longer meet its goals as projected, and will pass on the shortfall to anyone participating in the plan, Ritzma said. "We expect to see increased in our rates for pensions because of that. We will not see that in our current year, but in 2013, when they start with the new formula. We have in all our contracts cost-sharing language. The employees will share in the increased cost. We used to carry all our unfunded liability to CalPERS, but we pulled all that into a pension obligation bond. We got a fixed rate for our pension liability, between 1 percent and 5 percent, depending on the year. We will not be incurring that loss on our unfunded liability."

As it turned out, one of that tour’s two buses died early on, prompting everyone to load into the other bus — which had enough seats, so it was no big deal.

They sent it to me first as we are encouraged to re-up the permit / lease, and obviously it would be easier for them to maintain the space as is, than to have the park (cafe) go dark rolling into the summer.

The Star-Ledger obtained copies of ALEC model bills from the Center for Media and Democracy, a liberal advocacy group that uploaded nearly 800 of them to the internet last July.

All signs pointed to SLU being in the field, but there was still a slight level of anxiety in the room - "It was a mixture of nervous and exciting, which is a weird feeling," forward Cody Ellis said - though much of that was allayed when Xavier, a team SLU had beaten twice, was revealed as getting an at-large berth.

Few VCs could make comparable claims at such a young age, or be as clear as Efrusy about the entrepreneurs he wants to work with - people who sound a lot like Zuckerberg. "When I meet with someone, I ask myself: Are they stubborn? They should be. I'm not interested in someone who responds to the conventional wisdom of boards, or to MBAs like me. I'm interested in the person with a gut conviction of what their product is about and who sticks to it."
Sadly, there will be more situations in which our officers must act to defend themselves or us. We must let them know that when they do so appropriately and according to policy, we as a city will strongly support and fight for them. And we must send a clear message to those who would put the public and our officers at risk as well: If you suffer injury that results from your own violent crimes, don't look to L.A. taxpayers to pay for your medical care for life.

Following the success of two recent gatherings in Honolulu, plans are afoot for monthly Eat the Street rallies of novice and veteran vendors — check Streetgrindz.com for future events. But for the visitor, seeking out these eclectic cafes-on-wheels as part of an island-exploring itinerary is half the fun; the fact that prices may be half of resort fare may also be appetizing (just don't forget to bring cash.)
The governor certainly has a right to his opinion. But he should have the courage to stand up and say it is an opinion based on rejection of Catholic teaching and Maryland jurisprudence.
After a short debate we always start our Whites ski break at the same place: Our favorite peak is actually two - Attitash and Bear. Together they offer 300 acres ribboned with 73 trails - which is where I ski - including seven birch- and spruce-dotted glades (Moe's terrain) winding through Bear's woods. That means lots of choices for a long day on slopes that see about 15 feet of annual natural snow.

But I wouldn't make an overnight visit to this Ritz-Carlton until the staff can offer assurances that all offerings are up and running. And even after that, whether you're a lone grown-up or a traveling family, I don't think the Ritz-Carlton people have given us enough reason to pay Ritz-Carlton prices. After all, it's so much cheaper to sleep downstairs with their corporate cousins, and it's just about as much fun.

It was a sign of things to come. For the past 25 years, Emerson has been working on the radio. Since 1998, when he moved to Portland to host a talk show, Emerson has built a fan base so devoted its members have followed him through radio's inevitable ups, downs, format shifts, ownership changes and firings. Fueled by his obsession with pop culture, music, media and technology, Emerson resonated with listeners who share what he calls his "relentless geekery."
Saying they lost hundreds of millions a year under the old collective bargaining agreement, ratified in 2005, and believing that it favored large-market teams, owners sought significant changes in these negotiations.

For all the makeovers the Rams have been doing on the field and off, the best thing Kroenke and his people can do right now is to find a favorable resolution to the lease agreement with the CVC.

Citing the recent violence, the war opponents present two arguments for an early exit: 1) the anti-American protests show Afghans want foreign troops to leave; and 2) the troop-intensive counterinsurgency efforts have largely failed. Both these claims, however, are inaccurate. First, despite recent protests, a majority of Afghans support the presence of foreign troops in their country and do not want the return of the Taliban. ... Second, real counterinsurgency efforts in Afghanistan only began in early 2010, and have made remarkable progress since then. ... Further accelerating the withdrawal plan will undo the achievements of the past decade and will allow the Taliban and al Qaeda to re-establish their safe havens in parts of Afghanistan from which they could plot attacks on U.S. soil and against our allies in the region.

While "I Survived ..." might sound like your typical true crime show, there are several key differences. First, while many such shows rely on re-enactments of crimes to raise the dramatic stakes, "I Survived .¤.¤." tells its tales using only the words of the survivors, sparse subtitles and footage of the places where the crimes took place. There's no second-rate acting, no heavy-handed narration and only sparse use of the ominous synthesizer music that represents the show's one indulgence in audience manipulation.

What happens next amounts to a market vote on whether the yuan is overvalued, undervalued or close to its fair value. If the yuan trades at the upper limits of the band, it shows markets believe the yuan has room to rise. If the upward pressure is persistent, it could make Beijing reluctant to loosen further. A downward push, meanwhile, could indicate investor nervousness over China's slowing economy and the possibility of capital flight if China further loosens its capital restrictions.

At issue is a European Union proposal to make rose by blending white and red wines together. The French fear this will result in a flood of cheap wine.

OPIS chief oil analyst Tom Kloza said the average price could reach $4.25 per gallon by late March or April but the pace of the increase should slow.

The singers made the best of it. Richard Troxell was sympathetic as the elder Galileo, ably carrying the first scene; André Chiang took over as the younger man with similarly clear voice and stage presence. Bass Nicholas Nelson lent a grave bass to the role of Pope Urban VIII, and John Holiday, Matthew Hayward and José Rubio were strong and well-matched as his henchmen/Cardinals (Holiday's focused countertenor was especially striking). Lindsay Ohse beguiled as Galileo's daughter Maria Celeste and as the Duchess Christina, though she struggled to make vocal sense of her first appearance.

In short, we will have an untried divided central government, set up to do the bidding of foreigners, trying to rule a backward country seething with tribal hatreds -- with Libya’s multibillion-dollar oil industry as the prize for anyone ruthless enough, as Khadafy was, to emerge on top.

O'Leary, the No. 3-ranked player in the Sentinel's Florida Top 100, by Bill Buchalter, is a leader, a captain on the team.

Eye-popping shoes: "Especially with social media, where shoes are popping up on tweets, we'll see the girl who would never spend $100 on a pair of shoes drop $700 on shoes for her wedding day because she wants to wear a specific colored sole," Seizert said. "It goes along with what brides want in their photography. They want detail shots of shoes and jewelry." Colored shoes are becoming the norm for brides, particularly as their "something blue."

Economics aside, Sunday was still a beautiful day for baseball, on my first visit to Wrigley in years, squiring around my cousin Harry from Boston and his family. As regular readers know, I'm the sort who, left to my own devices, shuns sporting events. But I am a genial host, and Harry suggested we might take in a game, the way people speculate about travel to Mars - as a remote, wouldn't-it-be-something possibility, colored by his experience trying to get into Fenway Park, where you must plan to spend a fortune to buy the precious tickets passed from hand to hand, generation to generation.

Angelo traded the No. 4 pick in 2003 to draft Michael Haynes and Rex Grossman. Tommie Harris made three Pro Bowls but suffered two injuries that turned him into just another player. Greg Olsen was traded to accommodate Mike Martz's ill-fated offense. Chris Williams was injured the first day of his first training camp. Carimi was injured in his second regular-season game.

"We feel we have quality people there and it doesn't matter to me who starts. They're all going to play," he said following Saturday's practice. "So it's an `or' in that we get to the game-planning part and (if) the first play is going to be this, now that's play. He's starting. If the first play is going to be that, it's his play. So he's starting."

Tax cuts for workers have long been part of President Obama's economic stimulus agenda, starting with a tax credit of up to $400 annually in 2009 and 2010. Then in December 2010, Obama and congressional leaders agreed to replace that credit with a 12-month reduction in payroll tax rates. Obama later proposed to extend the payroll tax break for a second year, arguing that the economy couldn't withstand a tax increase.
Over the summer, the president demanded that lawmakers pass his patent reform bill, a highway construction bill, a bill to fund the Federal Aviation Administration and three pending trade deals.

Many people across the country have been accused of victimizing desperate homeowners since the real estate market collapsed in 2008, without facing a potential life sentence. What set Barnett's case apart was two prior "strikes" he received after pleading guilty to two burglary charges in the 1990s. That made him eligible for a life sentence if convicted of a new felony, as he was in March.

Picture perfect. Have a friend, ideally someone who knows their way around a camera, take a photo of you, your kids or your family and present it in a homemade frame, Favreau suggests. To do the latter, buy an inexpensive picture frame at a thrift store or dollar store and add your personal decorating touch. For example, coat the frame with mod podge (basically watery glue) then decoupage it with loving words cut from magazines, dried flowers or pictures that reflect her interests (flowers if she's a gardener; books if she's a reader).

Though young people in America have for decades struggled with financial literacy, state curricula haven't shifted much to address the gaps. Fewer than half of states make high school students take an economics class, and just 13 require a personal finance class, according to a 2011 survey by the Council for Economic Education. In those 13 states, though, the payoff is clear: Students who had taken such courses were more likely to go on to save money and pay off a credit card bill in full each month, and less likely to be compulsive buyers, max out credit cards and make late payments.

When Wally visits Sotheby's for the 1998 auction of the belongings of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, first the objects speak to her. Then, the late duchess materializes to advise and to commiserate. The objects - Windsor table linens, the Duchess' distinctive Cartier jewelry, her silken undergarments - drive the story rather than the characters who are stuck in marriages and unstuck in time. This is a chronology-challenged movie that boasts flashbacks within flashbacks and captions identifying where and what year its characters are without building any narrative momentum.

Adams set "Negative Love," one of the metaphysical poems of John Donne, and two by Emily Dickinson, "Because I could not stop for Death" and "Wild Nights." They're treated in a familiar pattern: a movement that grows incrementally, to a big finale; a slower, more contemplative movement; and an energetic, almost over-the-top conclusion.
Roots mine the soil for water and nutrients, so rooting space plays a role in irrigation management. Roots grow out, not down, so the size of your yard, soil conditions and competition between plants will influence how often you need to water. The smaller the area for roots, from small yard to containers, the more critical your irrigation management becomes.

(Closing statement)- "Let me conclude with this and then you've got more important things to do. This is not rocket science. They're not giant conspiracy theories.

That's where we're headed. I believe that with all my heart. That's where we're headed and I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about the team. We have a good coach, we have a good coaching staff, we are getting better players, we've got young people that I think will be here a while. There's a good feeling in the locker room. The business side of it is going okay. I think the owner's feeling pretty good, which helps me. What I would ask is that is to kind of spread the word a little. I think distractions are created and some of them are unnecessary. They just are. It's not helping anything and I understand everyone has a job to do. I get all that. Some of it, the distraction causes us to be less than our best at times because you are dealing with young people, immature at times, and they kind of don't understand the big picture. People can write that I'm leaving town Monday. It doesn't bother me all that much. We joked about it today because I kind of get it. If you write that about our starting quarterback, 'What do you mean I didn't tell anybody that.' They don't get it. I know you want us to do well, I know everybody wants the team to come back to their former glory. You can help with the formula, I guess that's what I'm saying. I appreciate it. Thanks for your time today."

We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure. Everyone involved made sacrifices. Everyone had some skin in the game. It wasnt popular. And it wasnt what I ran for President to do. But I ran to do the tough things  the right things no matter the politics.

There is not a polished, pithy joke to be found. The script is a flavorless stew of soap opera level romantic humbug. Essentially, the young Romeos who saw a couch as a place for a wrestling match have become listless bores who'd use it for an afternoon of beer, pizza and TV.

Director Faruk Aksoy divides his nearly three-hour movie among battle sequences, the love story and the various halls of power.

After Quincy Miller hit an uncontested 3-pointer from the top of the lane to give Baylor a 10-5 lead, Calipari lashed into his young team -- and did they respond.

I don't just want to work there; I want to live there, taking tickets from tourists from Cleveland, happily, all day, the rest of my life. Favorite street?

He hadn't been in his village in months, a scrap of a place tucked amid fields that stretch past the canal to the paved road. The boys on this land learn early to sharpen plow blades and make scarecrows out of grain sacks. It's cold when the rain blows and tough to make a living on, even for a man who cuts furrows.
The current plan would demolish about 10,000 houses and empty buildings in three years and pump new investment into stronger neighborhoods. In the neighborhoods that would be cleared, the city would offer to relocate residents or buy them out.

Meals on the double-decker Gold Leaf cars were served on fine white tablecloths and china. Each car has its own galley and every dish we tasted from our chef, Christos Caldeos, was extraordinary, from breakfast selections like poached egg over smoked meat on a fluffy crumpet, topped with piping hot Hollandaise sauce to dinner entrees of fresh salmon or bison steaks served to order and with a full range of trimmings.
Overall CEO pay was down in the valley, but while "2008 was a challenging year for everyone, companies in the technology and health care sectors seemed to fare better than most," Cwirko-Godycki said.

Four years ago, Keswick announced plans to develop land that the Baltimore Country Club planned to sell at its Roland Park location. Tension ran high in the community, to say the least. The longtime good relationship between Keswick and Roland Park was strained. Over time, thanks to the leadership of both organizations, that relationship is back on track. To me, this sponsorship and the quality tree-planting and landscaping efforts at Keswick speak volumes.

Over the years, there have been some great names associated with St. Louis soccer, both individuals like Charlie Colombo and Harry Keough and clubs like Scullin Steel and Stix, Baer and Fuller. But increasingly, those names are just names, and nothing more. They aren't connected to any flesh and blood. Just about everyone in St. Louis knows the city has had a major impact on soccer in America but just what that impact was, other than having a bunch of players on the U.S. team that beat England in the 1950 World Cup, gets increasingly hazy with each passing year.

“I’m disappointed with their assessment of the game,” Spencer said Tuesday. “But then that’s their prerogative. I think if it is too wet up there for them to play soccer then they may want to move that franchise because it pisses down rain nearly every time I’ve been in Seattle. Obviously to say that the conditions suit us more than they suit them just blows me away. It seems to me they had 50 excuses before the game written down as to why they never beat us 3 or 4 nil at home.”

He borrowed the name from a TV commercial for a credit card that supposedly was good even at the Last Place on Earth.

Bush staffers were well familiar with this routine, which is why they never would have allowed him to be in such a situation. Perhaps, as another close political observer suggested to me, the Obama White House has no such concerns. The media simply do not come after Obama in the same way they did Bush, notwithstanding recent research showing that Obama received the most negative coverage of any presidential candidate during the Republican primary. The Bush White House was under siege and conducted itself accordingly. No T's went uncrossed.
The group’s 2009 album, “The E.N.D.,” was a huge hit, powered by ubiquitous singles “Boom Boom Pow” and “I Gotta Feeling.” And the Peas already have a big 2011 planned, with a halftime appearance at the Super Bowl in February and a tour that is likely to include stadium shows.

Tina Otten's superb sextuplets
PACIFIC TREE FROGS: In Oregon, spring sounds like a loud, two-part kreck-ek or reb-it -- or at least it does if you've got Pacific tree frogs in the neighborhood. The 2-inch long frogs crank up the volume in spring, with males croaking vociferously and repeatedly aiming to attract females. When one frog starts the chorus, he stimulates other males to follow and their song fills the air.

In Old Bridge, Kenneth Popovich, principal of the township’s Carl Sandburg Middle School, said he likes the uniform idea because it would take pressure off of parents and school officials who have to reprimand students if they are dressed too provocatively. Old Bridge school board member Abhishek Desai said uniforms could be up to 75 percent cheaper than the clothes most students wear now. But he acknowledged the policy could stifle self-expression.
"It doesn't matter to me whether they're high school or junior college,'' Graham said. "We're looking for the best and brightest, guys with the best character, so we'll take them from all walks.

It was Haile's idea that Delamarter ask Weiner to give the book to a new museum planned in Ankober, Ethiopia, to be dedicated to Menilek. Delamarter had never made such a request of a book owner, he says. He'd been content to create digital copies and preserve the contents for the use of students and scholars.

Two of the Kings' four children, Martin Luther King III and the Rev. Bernice King, attended Monday's ceremony. Their brother, Dexter King, was unable to attend the service because he is recovering from injuries he received in a car crash last year. Yolanda King, the eldest of the King siblings, died in 2007. Bernice King is also president-elect of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which her father co-founded in 1957.
After the first Kings goal, Perron put the Kings right back on the power play at the end of the first period with a needless goaltender interference penalty. He made a great play to steal the puck on the forecheck and he muscled a good shot on goal while fighting off a check. But his collision with Quick was avoidable.

The patient wears the patches for 48 hours and returns to the office near day three and day seven of the test. This is because the reaction taking place between the skin and allergen is delayed, meaning it will take the skin time to show visible signs of an allergy.

That trait has been the Devils’ downfall all season. Yesterday, they only blew a one-goal lead. They blew three- and two-goal leads in the first round, and how does anyone survive that?
True, some of this is down to bad luck rather than bad judgment. The BOE couldn't have been expected to predict last year's escalation in the euro crisis or the Arab Spring. But the BOE must take the blame for grossly over-estimating the impact of sterling's devaluation. It has also badly under-estimated the weakness of the money supply: Despite pumping £325 billion ($523.98 billion) into the economy, equivalent to 20% of GDP, the U.K. broad money supply suffered its biggest quarterly drop in February since records began in 1963. Add the BOE's failure to predict the crisis—even in May 2008 it was still attaching a virtual zero probability of a recession—and it is clear something is wrong with its models.

The solution: Make your own veggie tray for less than $10. The biggest expense is the dip so swap it for a veggie or garlic hummus which costs between $2.99 and $3.99 for a 7-ounce tub. For the veggies, pre-sliced bags of baby carrots and celery are ready to serve and cost 99 cents each. Avoid combo-packs of cut vegetables because the convenience can add another dollar. Finally, include pita chips ($2.79 a bag) or Italian rolls ($3.29 a bag) cut into 1-inch slices.

As for Marley himself, he was notably shy for most of his life, and he's an elusive presence in the film's relatively few samplings of a limited archive of interview material—at one moment quietly charismatic, at another clearly druggy.

It’s no coincidence that increased prosperity has followed in the wake of stronger democratic institutions in Latin America. Nor is it surprising that Cuba, which is still not a democracy, is struggling. Looking toward a post-Castro era, Cubans are taking increasingly bold actions to secure for themselves the political and economic freedoms enjoyed by the majority of their fellow Latin Americans. The United States should support them by finding new ways to increase connectivity among Cubans and expand access to 21st century technologies on the island.

Eliminate, just for the sake of argument, the enhanced significance of kickoffs, now that the NFL has moved the sight of origination up to the 35-yard line, and that there has been a corresponding increase in touchbacks. Even minus that key element, kickers are critical for their placement abilities, and they understand the importance of consistently splitting the uprights from inside 50 yards.
Kilroy is no Gwen Moore or Henry Waxman -- Democrats from Wisconsin and California, respectively, who are among those tied for most liberal based on their voting records.

A standard service at Blowout, which opened in December, is $32, but Ms. De La Rosa charges $20 more for extra thick, long or coarse hair.

The translation: Rutgers and UConn could well be in the mix to round out a conference that could easily have two eight-team divisions. We'll call one "The North," since North and South would only be too perfect for the ACC's geographic football.

(Oh, and the South would be North Carolina, Duke, Wake Forest, N.C. State, Georgia Tech, Miami, Florida State and Clemson.)
A congressional map approved in September, largely by Republican lawmakers, creates 12 solidly Republican districts and four Democratic districts. It whittles down Ohio's 18 current congressional districts to 16 by pitting a pair of Democrats and a pair of Republicans against one another in two different districts. But Democrats have begun a voter referendum drive that could put the map on hold and prevent the new districts from being used for next year's congressional contests. That has prompted Republicans to negotiate.

A low point followed last weekend -- three one-run losses at Penn State, with the Nittany Lions winning every game in their final at-bat. Being swept dropped the Gophers to 28-19 overall and into a tie for 10th in the Big Ten at 7-11.

What Sowell's defense team or prosecutors could hope to learn from the Jackson family is unclear. What is clear is that the mayor has already learned plenty from the Sowell saga. It was Jackson, after-all, who appointed a special commission to study police procedures and the department's relationship with the community shortly after Sowell's arrest. Jackson followed that up with the creation of a six-person committee tasked with tracking the city's progress in improving police response to missing persons reports or sex crimes cases.

Just like I predicted, Proposition C (in Mehlville School District) was defeated because, like I said, all Republicans vote against tax increases, and that's why I am a Republican. I believe there should never be a tax increase. I don't care what it's for. That's what we believe in, no tax increase. That's what we say. And because I'm single, I'm 50-something years old, never had kids, these people need to think about having kids. They don't need them, they don't know how to take care of them. I take care of myself, all my cars, motorcycles, boats, my houses everything, that's what I think about. So, that's the way it is. ...

Federal and Pennsylvania authorities may yet take action against the drilling company, but it is Mr. Gansler's job to look out for the interests of the Maryland portion of the Susquehanna River and Chesapeake Bay, where polluted waters in eastern Pennsylvania eventually flow.

Novick is best known for his eclectic pursuit of justice, whether in taking on the Oregon Lottery Commission to collect more money for schools, challenging U.S. Sen. Gordon Smith in 2008 or repeatedly exposing the holes in Bill Sizemore's various initiatives. In some ways, Congress is a better fit for Novick than the Portland City Council, considering his wide-ranging interests and his tendency to focus nationally. It's easy to picture Novick getting restless during discussions of, say, off-leash dog areas.

It's dry, but a high dosage (from a bit of beerenauslese Riesling) notably softens its edges.

The other top scorer was Sara Lee Deep Dish ($8.49 for a 2-pound, 15-ounce pie, Safeway). Its label says "crust made with real butter" but the ingredient list shows that the main fat in the crust is shortening, a longtime crust staple that's recently hit the skids because it contains trans fat - 5 grams per serving, in this case. This pie has many more ingredients, including preservatives and artificial flavor.

But for many Band admirers, that honor belonged to the short, feisty Helm, whose authoritative twang once was likened to a town crier calling a meeting to order. He not only sang Dixie Down, he inhabited it, becoming the Confederate Virgil Caine, hungry, just barely alive, his brother killed by the Yankees, the South itself in ruins. It was the kind of heartbreaking, complicated story and performance that had even Northerners rooting for the proud and desperate Virgil.

I don't go to those, but Tracy does. I love a good theatrical documentary, though, and so we went together, early, of course, and I marked my seat by sitting in it. I watched the crowd amble in, some tottering a bit. All the Wagnerian passion in those frail bodies, I thought.

Matt Calkins: In response to charges that he was a shoot-first player with no regards to team success or defense, Jamal Crawford said last Friday that "a story could come out that I work at Voodoo Doughnut and everyone would believe it." Even so, I am going to assume that nba.com, espn.com, sports.yahoo.com and every other statistic-acquiring website did not conspire to label Crawford with a .384 field-goal percentage last season.

With Mayfield in the writer's seat, the Impressions paved a bold musical path throughout the next decade. They were one of the few soul groups of the era to write their own songs and to integrate horns and Latin rhythms into their gospel-based sound. Even more radical was the Impressions' - sometimes subversive, often overt - black-pride message. Though daring, this mix of pop music and politics worked for the group, which had 14 Top 40 hits in the '60s.

Five years later, Funny or Die, which McKay, Ferrell and "Entourage"executive producer Chris Henchy founded on a whim (and with the friendly urging of a venture capital firm), is way beyond baby steps. You might say, to keep the metaphor going, it already has graduated and become a media mogul: This fall there will be four Funny or Die-branded TV shows, two Web series and a movie in production, said CEO Dick Glover. It recently launched an iPad magazine, announced a deal to provide some of the in-flight entertainment for Virgin Airlines and started a commercial division. It's become the place where stars and corporations alike go to seem a little subversive. "The Landlord," the most-watched video in FoD history, has been viewed more than 80 million times, and the site gets 17 million visitors a month. Glover, who said Funny or Die became profitable in late 2010, has not ruled out the possibility ("someday, just not right now") of an initial public offering for Funny or Die stock.
This is just another artificial stimulus at our expense.

The custom led to a little-noticed but farcical episode in July 2003, when Communications Director Dan Bartlett held a White House briefing to defend the now-discredited national intelligence estimate of October 2002, which claimed Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. Throughout, the transcript refers to Bartlett as a "senior administration official," and news stories on the briefing duly credited a "senior administration official" or "White House officials." Four days later, Bartlett held another briefing on the same topic, in which he referred to several matters "I talked about last Friday." Inadvertently or not, Bartlett thereby revealed he was the same faceless official who had presided over the earlier briefing.

For Day 102, I did a treadmill while watching a few of the latter innings of the Indians' game. I jogged for eight minutes -- the first time I have jogged in two-plus months. A strained muscle in my back, then a pulled quad, kept me on the sideline. Thanks largely to the amazing work of massotherapist Karen Chorba, I have made tremendous progress on both fronts. I cannot imagine where I would be without Karen, whom I have known for years and who has helped expedite my healing from more than a couple of injuries.

Under the plea deal described in the media reports, Urdangarin would agree to plead guilty on condition prosecutors not seek a jail term of more than two years. The length of any sentence is key because first-time offenders in Spain - Urdangarin has no criminal record - who are convicted of a crime and sentenced to two years or less automatically receive a suspended sentence. So Urdangarin would not go to jail.
Consumers weren't always so keen to orange, however, said Eiseman, who wrote the new book "Pantone: The 20th Century in Color."

It all started to change as computers opened many doors in the 1990s.

"The E Street Shuffle"'
To minimize the temptation for employers to wait until a worker has been out of work for six months, we should make the amount the federal government will provide proportionate to the amount of time the employee has been out of work, sliding from, say, 10 percent of salary for an employee out of work at just six months up to the maximum of 50 percent at, say, a year out of work. To prevent dropping a current worker to hire a long-term unemployed worker at half the cost, the employer would have to refrain from laying off workers during the time it received the subsidy for the new workers, and a reasonable time beforehand. These conditions would actually lower the overall cost of the proposal.

I was trying to think of a strong historical analogy for President Barack Obama's sudden embrace of gay marriage this week, and the best I could come up with (thanks to my colleagues on the Free Press editorial board) was 1939, when First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt arranged for singer Marian Anderson to perform on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. That was after the Daughters of the American Revolution had prevented the renowned Anderson, who was African American, from singing for an integrated audience at Constitution Hall.

Rudd rises to the occasion, and then some. After the cramped quarters in New York, George is delighted with the elbow room of Elysium, as well as the flirty glances of Eva (Malin Akerman). The pretty blonde reminds him that at no-rules Elysium, the one rule is free love. The (obviously improvised) sequence in which George rehearses before the mirror how he will seduce Eva reduced me to a puddle of giggle.
The behavior: Sowell often showed signs of disinterest in the proceedings -- yawning, stretching, resting his chin on his hand -- right up until the jury delivered its verdict. But as Common Pleas Judge Dick Ambrose began reading the guilty judgments on 82 counts, Sowell's facial expression hardened, his eyes blinked rapidly and his breathing accelerated. When Ambrose finished and asked Sowell if he understood his right to an appeal, Sowell would not turn to face the judge and only mumbled an answer after prompted a second time.

The team even sent out a last-gasp email early this week to those who didn't renew, extending the deadline to Tuesday.

If McIlroy were to win, say, seven majors over his career, he would join an elite fraternity. Only 10 golfers have won as many: Nicklaus, Woods, Bobby Jones (13, including six U.S. and British Amateurs in an era when they were considered majors), Walter Hagen (11), Ben Hogan (9), Gary Player (9), Tom Watson (8), Palmer (7), Sam Snead (7) and Gene Sarazen (7). The youngest of that group to win a major was Sarazen, who proudly recalled that distinction at the 1996 Masters when somebody mentioned how skilled Woods was for a 20-year-old amateur.

Indeed, the European bailout was much larger than analysts expected, and represented an audacious step by European leaders who had been criticized for acting tentatively, and without unity, in the face of a mounting crisis.

“No one is being ordered,” said Boston Police Department spokesman James Kenneally. “A limited number of on-duty officers have been asked to attend the speech. The more that can attend, the better. Staffing levels will be sufficient to allow some, but not everyone, to attend the commissioner’s speech. The commissioner wants to take the opportunity to thank the men and women of the Boston Police Department for their hard work and dedication to duty.”

As for a generation ago, the OECD considered the United States the world leader because most of the world's college graduates were from the United States. In terms of percentage of population, though, the U.S. numbers were slightly behind the much smaller nation of Israel. That's a point of clarification.

I don't know about all of that. I need to be convinced that if the tournament expands to 96 teams why the first weekend of the tournament will still be as fascinating as it is now. My greatest fear is that if the NCAA isn't carefully monitored the added weekend of games will be nothing more than a glorified elimination tournament of the mid-majors or an excuse to continue to dump even more power-conference teams into the field no matter how lousy their regular-season records might be.
Even so, the sight of Rose going down late in Saturday’s 103-91 victory sent a major chill through Chicago and stirred a debate over whether he should have been in the game at that point.

I tried subterfuge.
If you're traveling in a country with questionable water, keep in mind that you have to avoid exposure to local water in all of its forms. That means no ice cubes (other than in high-end hotels that promise use of bottled water in their ice-making), brushing your teeth with bottled water, and avoiding taking in any water when you shower. Yes, it's often a fuss, but a bad bout of diarrhea is much more of a fuss.
The 2010 movie isn't as good as the book, and some people didn't think much of the book in the first place. But it's hard to fault the beautiful scenes of Rome and its eye for food from the "Eat" ("no carb left behind") portion of the movie about a woman's search for identity and true love.

In Castor & Pollux's case, Connolly said it kept its investment under wraps for competitive reasons.
Oskar's world starts off as a very narrow one. There is his working mom, with Bullock effectively dimming her normal bright light to play Oskar's not always likable mom, and John Goodman's insult-trading doorman offering some comic relief. The boy's main confidant, at least initially, is his grandmother. Played by veteran stage actress Zoe Caldwell ("The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie"), she lives in the facing apartment building, ideal for walkie-talkie conversations late at night when Oskar's worries escalate. Her apartment also houses the mysterious Renter (Max von Sydow), who will figure into Oskar's life in significant ways.

With the way Hamels has pitched and the Braves have hit lately, that 2-0 lead in the fourth did not look easily surmountable.

According to some Web noodling: Even sold as a single fryer, the chicken is probably worth $2 a pound. Figure you get half its weight in sellable meat and the butcher would charge for $5,000. Recycled steel fetches 13 cents a pound on a good day, so $650 for that route.
May 1 is International Workers Day, a holiday embraced in Europe, but not so much here.

"In the early '70s, wineries were paying the same amount for grapes no matter where they were from," Jeff says.

The latest chapter emerged in the last few years: a full-service movement that aims to make barbecue more routine than Chicagoans are used to.

As much as anything else in the movie, this cautionary lecture evoked the era when the Stooges reigned at kiddie matinees and low-rent TV stations. "Warning — kids!" we were always being told. "Don't try this yourself!" Solemn stories were told about the kid who shot his eye out with a BB gun, or ate a lot of Kool-Aid powder and then drank an RC Cola and his stomach exploded. As nearly as I can recall, nobody was hit over the head with a sledgehammer.

"I know what it's like to be judged, dissected, picked apart for all of my life," said the Russian-born tennis player who was arguably more famous for her willowy blond looks than for her court prowess.

Pixar, ultimately the more successful venture, seemed at first a bottomless money pit. Then in 1995 came "Toy Story," the first computer-animated full-length feature.

* Steelers pass rusher James Harrison used Media Day to mock NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. Harrison was fined repeatedly by Goodell this season for helmet-first hits on quarterbacks and receivers. "I don't want to hurt nobody," Harrison said. "I don't want to step on nobody's foot or hurt their toe. I just want to tackle them softly on the ground and if you all can, we'll lay a pillow down where I'm going to tackle them, so they don't hit the ground too hard, Mr. Goodell."

When the Mariners faded in 2010, they put Lee on the market. Cashman thought he had a deal in place for Lee, but at the last minute, Zduriencik sent Lee to Texas. Montero was a key part of the package the Yankees were offering, but Zduriencik liked Texas first baseman Justin Smoak more.

CB Bruce Johnson ruptured his Achilles’ tendon in practice to night, which means his 2011 season is over before it even began. The 2009 undrafted free agent, who played in all 16 games as a rookie and recorded two interceptions that year, will land on injured reserve for the second straight season. Last year, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in November.

The Hornets are used to being the class of PSAL boys lacrosse and are the league’s defending Class A city champions. With 16 seniors graduated, though, this year has gotten off to a much slower start. Building early momentum was hurt by the fact that renovations are being done on the Hornets home field, thus limiting practice times and routines.

That scenario would provide space in the old Southeast Precinct building, or Penumbra Kelly Building at 4747 E. Burnside St. that the city is purchasing, for the police bureau to reopen it as a precinct and bring patrol services back there for Southeast neighborhoods. The plan also is to use the building to house the Water Bureau's security staff and the Office of Neighborhood Involvement's crime prevention program, and call it a Community Safety Center.

They tried to hire new surgeons. They crafted a marketing campaign to attract new patients. They begged regulators for more time. They sidelined people who complained and looked past doctors' egos and what Hoefs described as their "peculiar behaviors." They hung on by persuading two doctors from UC San Diego to work part-time.
The right plan can artfully incorporate more furnishings than you might expect. Smaller scaled bedroom sets and efficient storage are key to keeping the space feeling uncluttered and welcoming. Anything that serves more than one purpose – such as an end-of-bed storage bench or a bedside table that has several drawers – is especially welcome. A small room tends to draw more attention to displays of collectibles, so create small groupings of your favorite things and use them to draw the eye to certain areas of the room. Keep in mind that you can increase the sense of spaciousness by choosing closed, streamlined storage. Tables, beds and chairs that sit high off the floor make rooms appear airier and less cluttered.
Tokyo's market found some support after the improved U.S. manufacturing numbers helped to lift the greenback back above the ¥80 mark overnight.

But more movie choices don't necessarily mean more moviegoers, who perhaps thanks to an improving economy have been turning out in greater numbers than expected.

Matthew Davis tells us he doesn’t care what you think about the records he likes. But don’t judge him on that — judge him by what he’s willing to spin at parties. On the ambitious “Last Glittering Thrill,” he hands us a playlist, singing about the old Three O’Clock and Plasticland records on his turntable. Those bands made sharply written psychedelic guitar-pop — immersive, urgent, occasionally murky and pleasantly skewed. He’s chased — and captured — those virtues himself on “Believe in Sound,” the debut album by his latest outfit, the Thousand Pities. A longtime Garden State resident who now lives in Montclair, Davis has made some talented friends in Jersey pop: Stanley Demeski of the Feelies plays percussion on the brief “From the Air,” Deena Shoshkes of the Cucumbers sings harmony on the engrossing “Point Pleasant.” Davis’ regular band is awfully impressive, too, especially powerhouse drummer Ken Meyer and synth player Billy Donohue, who adds twinkle and purr to the occasionally downcast material. As for Davis himself, he possesses an emotionally resonant, weather-beaten voice that he puts to good use on ballads “Super-High Moon” and “Gone to Stay.” One of the best local releases of 2011 so far? Heck, forget about “local.”
Securing credit from a commercial lender can be a challenge for any farmer. It's especially challenging for new producers, who lack a long business history, and for farmers and ranchers with less conventional business models. That includes those selling to local stores, restaurants, and institutions or directly to consumers – Oregon's local food producers.
Dicecapades: Outnumbered (Haywire, $26; 3-6 players; age 12+; 30 min.) A promising idea for a light, fast-moving trivia game that founders on the reefs of poor follow-through. Each player rolls 10 dice, then competes with others to answer questions whose answers are all numbers; the trick is that you're eligible to answer only if all the digits in your answer are represented among your dice. Unfortunately, nearly all the questions are either too easy (quarts in a gallon) or too hard (languages spoken worldwide) to be any fun. And some are pure dada, like "Q: Paul Revere's ride? A: 12."

Beyond that, however, no additional Harford highway improvements have been funded past the conceptual stage, and the state has actually pushed back consideration of adding additional travel lanes on I-95 north of Route 24 in Abingdon. Harford County elected officials believe the interstate highway needs to be widened to a uniform width through the county, with a new interchange built at I-95 and Route 22, the latter being the main route into APG for people who work on post. Also long unresolved is the widening of Route 22 from Aberdeen to Route 543 east of Bel Air, the main route from the interior of the county to Aberdeen.
It apparently is unhip to have a staircase with risers. Risers are the boards the toe hits when a foot goes too far on the step. Minimalist steps seemingly float in air (and handrails are optional). I climb such stairs with great care, mindful of a friend whose leg slipped through. He snapped a quadriceps and spent two months in rehab. He was not a hipster, it is true.

"The first time she got the region player of the year award as a freshman, she asked, 'What's this for?'" Barris said. "When I told her, she asked, 'Well, what did everybody else on the team get?' She's so modest and puts the team before anything. She's a different kid."
"All the major candidates were excluded because of not fulfilling one or two of the legal conditions," said Amr Hashim Rabee, an analyst at Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies in Cairo.

When a ballplayer starts the season 0-for-12, his first hit is not just a breakthrough, but an unburdening.
To anyone with a functioning memory, however, this whining is implausible. So are the dire predictions that the president will somehow offend voters by claiming credit for whacking bin Laden (or by smacking Romney). During the Bush presidency, Republicans used precisely the same approach and worse, over and over, without fretting whether their words and ads were "divisive."
Take memory. Thirty-year-olds forget lots of things, but they don't blame dementia. Older people jump to the conclusion that memory failures are part of their inevitable decline, when in fact it could be that their values change about what's meaningful enough to remember, Langer said.

But meeting fans' expectations could prove challenging, Dolich said. Not all venues are well suited for Wi-Fi or for offering decent cellphone connection, he said. And fans aren't going to be happy if, even with the new technology, the team can't handle what Dolich calls "the basics," like keeping waiting lines short at the concession stand or in the parking lot.

So why not bring up Mike Trout, just as they did Peter Bourjos, give him the Bobby Abreu at-bats so he can experience more big league pitching sooner and at the same time provide more speed in the outfield and on the bases? Wouldn't that impact the club? Or is waiting three weeks for each Abreu RBI a better idea?

A lot of people, if asked to pick their favorite Van Morrison album, would go with 1968's "Astral Weeks."

I left Iraq last summer after covering the conflict there for two years as a Los Angeles Times correspondent. There's a lot not to miss: the carnage, the ubiquitous sense of menace, the logistical barriers of reporting a story in a place where foreign journalists are shut out from much of Iraqi society. But there is also a deep sense of regret for having left behind so many Iraqi colleagues and friends, people who repeatedly risked their lives for me and others. Most have no chance to leave. It is hard to avoid feeling that I abandoned them, though none ever puts it that way.

Along with the Kenny Wilson Award for Excellence, the team and family have decided not to retire his jersey. Rather, they have decided to promote it to the highest honor.

Every year the #59 jersey will be awarded to the lineman that best exemplifies integrity, leadership, desire, and ability the way Kenny would want it done. This year Kenny's younger brother Pete will wear the jersey while being a ball boy for the team at the games.

Now, my family is spread out around the country -- and the chocolates don't travel well. So I created a cookie version of the confection to capture similar flavors. The cookie base has a slightly chewy, brownie-like texture, with a crackling chocolate top. Since cherries are not in season, dried cherries are coarsely chopped and studded throughout the batter. The recipe calls for extra chocolate chunks that ooze from the baked cookies; they add a level of intensity that can easily be omitted.

Who knows what Urlacher is like outside of football? But Urlacher's public persona today is what a star professional athlete should be. He still won't give you deep thoughts if he doesn't have any.

It takes a lot to play that way, but all the top teams play that way. The whole game is about back pressure, tempo and 200 feet.

Industry experts say there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the port of Norfolk. They say it has excellent facilities, as well as railroad connections that Baltimore and other ports can only envy.

Credit for the boulevard's promising start goes to the design concept, which is a collaboration between Jacobs Macdonald: Cityworks and city staff led by the Department of Public Works. If anything, you wish the planners had won a few more battles. The "local" lanes should have bumpy paving to give drivers a tactile cue to slow down, for instance. But the convenience of having asphalt over the boulevard's buried service lines won out with engineers.
On April 3, the Reserve Bank of Australia said it might cut rates if inflation doesn't become a problem.

SCOUTING REPORT: Kentucky's size, speed and scoring ability from anywhere on the court present nightmarish problems for most opponents. The Wildcats are the best transition team in the country and also hold opponents to nation-best 37.5% shooting. Terrence Jones is a streaky player but when he's playing well Kentucky is all but unbeatable. Anthony Davis, of course, is a shot-blocking fiend with his 7-5 wingspan but has improved offensively during the course of the season. Louisville has trouble generating points but has won of late with a stingy 2-3 zone defense that likes to funnel traffic inside toward center Gorgui Dieng, who averages more than three blocks a game.

Best smackdown: This one was delivered by Seminole County Supervisor of Elections Mike Ertel, who was there as a neutral party to talk about the effect on local ballots.

Taylor took over as quarterback after Mertens sustained a rib injury in the fourth quarter.
The Bears seem to believe they will upgrade their offensive line with the return of injured right tackle Gabe Carimi and injured left guard Chris Williams (with the unspoken upgrade of Mike Tice coordinating the offense instead of Mike Martz).

The effort was supposed to be financed by a $15 per acre charge to those companies that hold gas interest to the land. The Maryland Department of the Environment was counting on collecting as much as $2.3 million from the study fee to pay for research.

If you can read only one book, however, it should be "Titanic: First Accounts" (Penguin), in which editor Tim Maltin gathers classic inquiries and early testimonies from survivors. It is a stunning record of firsthand stories and early reports. "The ship was gradually turning on her nose — just like a duck does that goes down for a dive," recalls radio operator Harold S. Bride.

Controlling your PC or Mac remotely becomes a completely different thing on the new iPad. The Retina display has greater resolution than many laptops, even. When you run an iPad VNC client (like Screens or iTeleport), the experience is very close to that of having a fully-functional -- albeit slightly slow -- desktop computer in front of you. Even when you're connecting back to your desktop computer via an LTE connection, it's quite a credible experience. There's no need to scrunch the screen down to give yourself enough working room, and you don't need to zoom in to make things legible and useful.
"A dance teacher who was laid off would not come back because a mathematics teacher retired," said John Crowe, superintendent of the Woodbridge school district, where about 25 percent of certified staff was eligible to retire.
Duckworth was a starter on two NBA Finals teams with the Blazers, reaching that pinnacle through hard work and self-motivation. Duckworth attended Thornridge High School, a basketball power outside of Chicago, and did not make the basketball team his freshman year because he missed school the day of tryouts.

The Charlotte Observer, the state's largest newspaper, voiced opposition to the amendment: "North Carolina already bans same-sex marriage by state law so this constitutional change is unnecessary.

I'm beginning to suspect that the Oval Office teleprompter may be malfunctioning, or that perhaps that NBC News producer who "accidentally" edited George Zimmerman into sounding like a racist has now edited the smartest president of all time into sounding like an idiot.

So far, I thought, looking up at the startlingly bright desert stars, so good.
Christie, a Republican, campaigned for GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Brady, who lost the election to Democrat Pat Quinn.

Is that why Eric took Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Paquin) prisoner at the end of last week's episode -- as bait to lure Russell into a confrontation? Sookie, after all, just learned that she's part fairy and that her blood is particularly intoxicating and desirable to vampires. Any way you play this high-stakes game, Sookie is going to have some major trust issues with the vampires in her life.

This band from Stillwater, Okla., follows the map drawn by its honky-tonk forebears: driving fiddle, and touring the well-worn Red Dirt route through Arkansas, Texas and New Mexico. But lead songwriter Evan Felker also calls up contemporary images, such as the soldier writing a letter "beneath a big Afghan moon" in "Southeastern Son," and a vivid car crash in "Before the Devil Knows We're Dead."

Agatha Christie was not cozy. She earned the title the Queen of Crime the old-fashioned way — by killing off a lot of people. Although never graphic or gratuitous, she was breathtakingly ruthless. Children, old folks, newlyweds, starlets, ballerinas — no one is safe in a Christie tale. In "Hallowe'en Party," she drowns a young girl in a tub set up for bobbing apples and, many chapters later, sends Poirot in at the very last minute to prevent a grisly infanticide. In "The ABC Murders," she sets up one of the first detective-taunting serial killers.

That's a notable thing about Joshua Tree National Park and the towns around it. While legions of Californians keep their faces to the beach, no matter the season, a certain stripe of traveler is powerless to resist the desert, especially in cooler months. They come for the wide-open spaces and quirky lodgings you see in the park-adjacent towns of Joshua Tree and 29 Palms. They come for the bands at Pappy & Harriet's, for the steaming pools of lithium-rich water at Desert Hot Springs or maybe for a sound bath (to be explained soon) at the Integratron in Landers.

"The insurgency has been beaten back to a considerable extent. This summer offers them an opportunity to not only repulse Taliban attacks like the one in Kabul last month, but also to expand their safe zones and reduce internal (insurgent) sanctuaries, which in turn will - in theory - give the (Afghan forces) and the government an opportunity to set in a little bit more deeply."

The factors that have separated the teams have been minimal, namely the Blues' power play (or, depending how you view things, San Jose's penalty-killing) and their goaltending. Brian Elliott stopped 24 of 25 shots in Game 4, some spectacularly, while the Blues have scored on six of 16 power plays. It will behoove San Jose not to take any silly penalties. Meanwhile, the Sharks have scored on two of 15 power plays.

Following the Feb. 23 board meeting, somebody left the tape running on a machine used to record the minutes. Tarantino, who has since apologized for the incident, is heard on the tape using vulgar language to describe parents, other board members and the Democratic Party. In response, the two board members propose various acts of retribution against the parents as well as an inclination toward dereliction of duty, should Tuesday’s election deny them the political majority. With that majority, comes the right to award pricey contracts to politically connected professionals.

Greg Couch, FoxSports.com: "The Self image has more than evolved in the past few years, it has transformed. Bill Self used to be a TV-ready salesman with a nice smile, a warm handshake and a friendly little drawl. If he meets you today, he will remember two years later what you were wearing, and ask about specific family members. He could land great recruits, but then couldn't win big with them. It was a classic coaching category: Great recruiter, can't coach. Now, he is a coaching guru, a genius. Did Self change, or was it just his image? Is it just the way we label coaches and athletes, everything so black and white? This is fact: Self has lost early in the NCAA tournament with great teams. The title he won? Five of his players were selected in the next NBA Draft. Who can't win a college title with a pro team? Whatever, this much is also true: This Kansas team is not loaded. The one time Self's recruiting let him down, he has had to rely on his own wits and skills."

Some will be uncomfortable with the idea of a "living truth" because it accepts flexibility according to time, place, and circumstance in a nasty world of change. But those who are observant have witnessed again and again that when absolutist offenders of ethics and the law get caught, their first line of defense is to argue they should be excused because of time, place or circumstance. They suddenly become poster board displays of situational ethics.

And now Spielberg is set to deliver the biggest blast from the past yet. "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is not exactly the movie you might expect to follow "Munich." But then again, he once shuttled between "Schindler's List" and "Jurassic Park." Of his contemporaries, Spielberg has probably undergone the greatest sea change throughout his career. The "Indiana Jones" franchise, like the "Jurassic Park" movies, are a palate cleanser for him -- a cackle in between epic kvells. For this teacher's pet, the class syllabus changed a long time ago.

Dear Margo: I work for a small company on a team of four women in their late 20s. There's a problem with one of my colleagues that might strike you as odd. "Mary" suffers from severe PMS. Several days before the onset of her menses, she turns into a nightmare. Moreover, she gets a leave of absence for a couple of days each month because she feels ill when she has her period. I'm not a freak who makes another lady's cycle her business, but after working so closely for two years, you just notice such things. In the first months of working together, I sympathized, but it's getting to be too much now. She's not the easiest person to begin with, but during the week prior to her period, she becomes intolerable. I am getting fed up covering her workload when she is out. I gently suggested she consult a doctor. Her answer boils down to "no use seeing a doctor, that's the way I was born." I brought this up to our boss, who told me he is aware of the behavior but is reluctant to let her go because of her knowledge of our company, which is true. Also, he is reluctant to deal with the whole subject. Should I start looking for another job? Should I start nagging our boss? — Feeling Stuck

In Luke chapter 8, we have the Parable of the Sower recorded (verses 4-8). Later in this chapter after Christ is asked about the parable, He explains it (verses 11-18). What is important is that Christ said the 'seed" is God's word. You see, even when we think we have failed as a Christian spouse, parent, teacher or leader of a congregation, as long as we live the faith, teach the faith and abide in the faith, we have planted the seed: the word of God (Luke 8:11-18; Gal 2:20; John 15:10; James 1:22-27).

Meanwhile, some observers have criticized the paper for unmasking lawmiss, and there is some merit to that. It's wrong to offer anonymity, then yank it away.

As NFL offenses have evolved, the role of the fullback -- Jim Brown's position, for heaven's sake -- has been relegated to pure blocker. A series of rules changes since 1974 have made it harder for defensive backs to cover receivers while also providing more protection for quarterbacks.

-- Riley was also happy with the growth of the linebackers, and said that when D.J. Welch is healthy (he sat out the last few days with a hamstring issue) he has shown tremendous promise. The same can be said for Michael Doctor and Feti Unga, though Unga will need to prove it in games. Riley said he thinks Unga was "a good playmaker" in spring ... Doctor was mentioned by a handful of people during April has someone with the killer instinct OSU has seemed to lack the last few seasons.

For adults, there is artistry and allusions aplenty even in Hans Zimmer's score (surely someone will come up with a trivia game to cover the countless film references woven into nearly every scene). There is giggle-inducing slapstick, high-stakes showdowns and even a moral to this story for the kids. All of which combine to create an Old West that is downright good old-fashioned entertaining.
On the outskirts of the city, Tommy and Andy are the first team to discover the next Detour, which is divided into "Grass Fed" or Rice "Field." In Rice Field, teams have to deliver lunch to a group of rice farmers and then plant 300 rice shoots in the mud. The Grass Fed challenge requires teams to fill two bags with grass, collect two lambs and then fill a trough with six buckets of water. Like most restaurants these days, the teams are heavily about Grass Fed, even though it may actually be the harder challenge, what with the sheep herding. As Tommy and Andy collect their grass and walk their sheep, Laurence and Zac, the father-and-son adventurers, soon catch up. However, Laurence and Zac fail to read their clue closely and inadvertently bend the rules using four buckets, when the clue indicates only two per team. Tommy (or Andy, it's hard to tell them apart) warns them to read their clue closely, but they ignore the advice.

His loose take on “pepper pot” was also intriguing, focused on a soft hunk of slow-braised short rib.

Some of these "subsidiaries" are nothing more than postal boxes. In fact, there is a single building in the Cayman Islands that is home to 18,857 registered corporations. Companies that make profits in America benefit from our roads, education system and security. They should therefore pay taxes to support those benefits like the rest of us, plain and simple.

But I'm in the mood. After six or more months of chill and ice crystals in Northeast Ohio, the ground is soft and fragrant. Seemingly overnight, things are growing as if we were in the tropics.
